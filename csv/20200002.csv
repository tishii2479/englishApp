* is necessary to state this much plainly_ because when a paper or an article pertaining to the \"great national sport\" appears in a review or magazine_ it is at once stigmatised by the sporting journals as containing only \"pipers' news_\" and in the view of the critics it may be so but such articles are not written to instruct the critics_ but to inform the public.,It,chosen,night,Beginning

It will_ perhaps_ be thought by some persons that the dark side of things is too much dwelt upon in the following pages_ that too much is said about the frauds and chicaneries of the turf_ and too little about the brighter aspects of the sport_ but it must be borne in mind that racing has unfortunately become a \"business\" of the most sordid kind the majority of the men engaged in the \"sport\" run their horses only as * of gambling_\" whilst not a few of them to ensure success condescend to practices that will not bear the light of day.,\"instruments,successively,fiercely,begin

Betting and \"turf profligacy\" of * kinds were in these times indulged in at Newmarket to an extent far beyond the bounds of morality and prudence_ and_ although King and Court were_ so to put it_ in \"the swim\" of all that occurred_ an Act of Parliament required to be passed to restrain gaming and betting on race-horses to an excessive amount \"on tick or credit.,all,thumbs,\"Keep,Newland's

In one or two instances where the clerk of the course acted also as handicapper_ as well as being lessee of the * stand_ it is said that it was his custom to \"retain\" all the big stakes in plain language_ it has been more than once implied that some handicappers were allowed_ by certain owners_ to keep the stake-money_ on condition of the horses entered by them being favoured in the apportioning of the weights.,grand,Or,latterly—that,proposals

In addition to the racing news contained in the ordinary run of newspapers_ there are three daily journals published all the year round which are solely devoted to sporting news_ and these papers deal of course in \"tips_\" and some of them afford a place in their columns to a full score of the daily increasing army of vaticinators and yet_ as must be patent * those who devote time and attention to the study of such matters_ no betting man could possibly make a fortune_ or even earn a living_ by abjectly following either or all of the honest newspaper tipsters referred to.,to,moderation,deliver,talk

When one of them_ for instance_ after a period of six or seven *_ becomes some day so fortunate as to select three or four horses that win as many races_ it shouts out next day in loud tones so that all may have news of its prescience—a supremely Irish mode of telling readers that to follow its tips would be ruinous.,weeks,quaint,Walker's,taking

But what of that_ when backers of the two lost their money_ the romping in horse starting at odds of 3 to 1 on him!

His idea of the kind of persons he had supposed them to be was at once corroborated_ as the first of them with whom he could obtain an interview he immediately recognised as a bookmaker who had welshed him at Ascot two years before another of the fraternity was identified by a friend as a \"swell cabman_\" who used to have a lucrative connection in the City_ his customers being chiefly stockbrokers and bankers' clerks but more surprising than either of these was the discovery that among the motley crowd_ and evidently_ from the fact of two * in an outer office being busily engaged in filling up telegraphic forms_ doing a roaring trade_ there was a younger son of a very well known and wealthy London citizen_ who_ having failed at the University_ and \"gone to the bad\" in business_ had taken to tipping.,clerks,Dog,H.,Drummer
Could a census be taken of these prophets_ embracing their antecedents_ it would be found that not a few of them were persons who had lost money in backing horses or in laying the odds against their chances_ reminding us of the celebrated definition * the critics being \"men who have failed in literature and art.,of,bridled,Derby\",superintended

\" * the present time there are tipsters who carry on business in different fashions some ask for a fee that will cover a week's work_ others seek an all-day remittance_ whilst not a few deal in single-horse wires or \"paddock snips_\" as they designate their information.,At,Its,state,inattention

No data exists to show when the professional bookmaker as we know him came upon the scene but it may be taken for granted that the \"penciller\" was not evolved at once_ but that the system grew by means of what it fed on_ originating_ doubtless_ in the practice adopted by certain gentlemen who_ having made a series of bets_ were anxious in consequence to get \"round_\" as the process of hedging is called_ or_ in other words_ to be in a position not to lose their money_ or_ to put the matter still more explicitly_ to possess a fair chance of * something and losing nothing.,winning,equality,computed,(£500)

\" Further_ Mr. Day says the practice of ready money betting is \"a blot on the nationality * every Englishman!\" Unfortunately for himself_ Mr. Day stultifies his own arguments against ready money betting by his advocacy of the Pari-mutuel plan of backing horses_ which is a ready money system of betting _ the adoption of which Mr. Day thinks would put a stop to reckless speculation_ as_ indeed_ would ready money betting conducted through the medium of the bookmakers (who ought to be licensed).,of,\"Her,handicap,imperative
The writer of these pages_ as is obvious enough_ is quite of the * opinion as Mr. Day_ that \"so long as a man can go into the ring and bet his untold thousands upon race after race_ not having as many hundreds to pay his losses with_ so long as he can find usurers to supply him with the needful to be paid on the Monday after_ then so long_ too_ will he continue to bet_ little caring what he pays for the convenience as things are he is compelled to raise funds to save his credit and his respect among his aristocratic associates_ but in the other case (of Pari-mutuel betting) there would not be such pressing necessity for him to have the money.,same,1606,payer,instead

The arrangement usually made was that the more responsible country bookmakers_ _ those in the larger provincial towns and cities_ should be communicated with_ and be asked to lay the odds against \"so and so\" to a specific amount and at a given price_ or no limit might be given in the matter of price but a particular hour was generally named at which the commission * desired to be executed by the bookmaker or other appointed agent_ so that all the money required was usually obtained by this plan of doing the work.,was,back,hack,married

Both men were of * origin.,humble,I've,maintain,abatement
Ridsdale was born in York_ and earned a small wage in his early days as helper in a livery stable_ from which * was promoted to be a groom to the first Earl of Durham_ then Mr. Lambton.,he,\"In,leap,order
Robert Ridsdale after a time_ having given up service_ made his appearance on the turf as an adventurer_ and from the * success appears to have attended his efforts.,first,firm,enrichment,opponent
He had formed an extensive and profitable acquaintance with many of the northern trainers and jockeys_ * at the period_ say from 1815 onwards_ were busy in the racing world the sport of kings at the time indicated being in a flourishing condition in the North_ where the training stables were crowded with famous horses_ the riders of which had earned reputations on the turf.,who,married,bid,nose
Ridsdale was fortunate_ as the saying goes_ to get into many of the \"good things\" of those days_ and_ judging by the * establishment he was speedily enabled to set up in the neighbourhood of York_ he must_ almost at the outset of his turf career_ have discovered a way of \"making\" large sums of money.,fine,scene,crop,fought
Among his patrons was * Honourable Edward Petre_ who for some years_ \"in the days when George the Fourth was king_\" enjoyed the favours of fortune on the racecourse_ having won the St. Leger on four different occasions_ three of his wins being in consecutive years.,the,general,correspond,victorious
John Gully was a racing man * great notoriety_ and became a Member of Parliament.,of,touch,communication,roped
In * earlier years he is known to have played the parts of butcher_ prize-fighter_ publican_ hell-keeper_ and bookmaker_ carrying on at one time a gigantic business in the latter capacity.,his,Faith,victimised,description
Gully * a pugilist in those days when boxing was most thought of_ and when fighting men were patronised by persons of honour and respectability.,was,Agrippa,barren,exercised
As a *_ Gully was a man of indomitable courage_ as plucky in the roped arena as his partner Ridsdale was in the hunting-field.,boxer,distant—when,Additional,Bertha
It was while carrying on business as a publican that Gully saw his way to fortune in the betting ring like some other shrewd persons_ he early discovered that \"backing\" horses was an unprofitable *_ having come to the conclusion that the chief gains of the turf remained in the hands of the men who laid the odds.,avocation,supreme,(1873),offerings
\"Backers_\" as they are called_ go down before the bookmakers like so many ninepins_ whilst the layers of * odds to all comers continue to stand up and grow rich.,the,1727,predominating,devil
Impressed with that view of the situation_ Gully speedily became a professional betting man_ or \"leg_\" as such persons were then termed_ and_ by paying intelligent * to business_ met with prompt and extraordinary success.,attention,plunger\",yet,Blank\"
He commenced at a fortunate time—just_ indeed_ as betting was beginning to be recognised as a business_ and when men were awakening * and more to the fact that it was better for them to deal with a professional layer of the odds all round than to make bets with each other.,more,instruct,Plates,swim
Gully speedily attracted attention in the *.,ring,raiment,residents,Day's
Gentlemen who had taken notice of his native shrewdness and capacity for figures entrusted him with commissions to back their horses_ so that_ in a manner_ fortune was thrust upon him_ the many secrets he became possessed of in this line of business enabling him to work in a powerful light_ whilst his less fortunate brethren of the ring had to carry on * betting work pretty much in the dark.,their,talked,shortest,subscriptions
The commissions with which he was so frequently entrusted showed Gully what were the expectations of owners_ and not only which horses might win_ but also some as well which were sure to be beaten because on the turf there was then_ as there is now_ two kinds of \"commissions\"—one to back a given horse_ or it might be two or three horses_ for the same event_ the other to * against animals meant to lose.,lay,feature,withheld,DAMAGES
With \"such dispositions of things\" in his favour_ he is * poor hand at the business who cannot_ when the struggle is over_ show a winning balance.,a,assist,horse-race,foal
The days of Gully were those of heavy betting_ so far as individual speculation was concerned that is to say_ there might then be a hundred men on the turf who * to stakes of hundreds or thousands but at the present time_ although individual bets are not perhaps made to such large amounts_ the number of persons who bet is as hundreds to one to what the number was when John Gully was a prominent person in the ring.,betted,\"doing\",1873,winnings
At the \"period\" referred to_ say from about 1818 to 1840_ race-horses were less numerous than they are at *_ and bookmakers_ moreover_ were not so plentiful as now but most of them managed to do a good business and to put money in their purses.,present,Lane,Bashaw,simile
Gully_ gathering experience day by day_ was soon able to play a prominent part in the heavy speculations which formed a feature of the turf in those times and whenever he thought any commission entrusted to him was a really good one—that is to say_ as denoting the chance of the horse to win—he followed the lead of his employer_ and by doing so often won considerable sums whilst if he knew_ as he * did_ that a horse was sure to be beaten_ he would spiritedly lay the odds against its chance of winning.,frequently,declared,www,trumpet
* is recorded that on one occasion he was engaged to back two horses in a race to win_ and_ along with a confederate_ he had five to lay against the two which he backed to win ran first and second_ the others_ as had been \"arranged_\" came in a long way behind the winner.,It,figure,blackguard,Among
A few * of that kind soon bring grist to a betting man's mill.,chances,Fordham,mildly,\"handicapped\"
By the year 1827 Gully's business had so flourished that he was able to purchase for £4_200 (then a large sum to pay for a horse) the winner of that year's Blue Ribbon of the turf—Mameluke_ the property * Lord Jersey.,of,imposts,\"Borderer's\",suggest
The horse was bought with a view to winning the St. Leger_ and the transactions made by Gully on behalf of his purchase afford a glimpse of the betting figures of * period.,that,phrases,face,working
As * as the bargain had been effected between Lord Jersey and himself_ Gully requested that it should not be made known till he had obtained a good opportunity of backing the horse for the great race of September (the St. Leger)_ which he was enabled to do at Ascot.,soon,dictates,transparent,circles
* that famous race meeting he accepted the odds of 10 to 1 against his horse to the tune of £1_000_ thus standing to win £10_000 if his horse should prove victorious at Doncaster.,At,successful,powerless,topped
Not contented_ however_ with that considerable speculation_ Mr. Gully made several other bets_ as_ for instance_ one that Mameluke would beat ten horses (in * St. Leger)_ which horses he at once named likewise that his colt would beat a lot of nine horses in the same race—these he also_ of course_ named.,the,fragments,1795,diamond
All three bets were made for the same amounts_ namely_ £10_000 to £1_000_ and in the end they had to be paid by Mr. Gully_ as_ unfortunately for him_ the name of Matilda_ the horse which won the St. Leger of 1827_ was written in both lists_ so * after the St. Leger had been run he found he had a sum of £3_000 to pay_ every penny of which was duly handed over—two-thirds of it to Crockford—on the day of reckoning.,that,practical,tardily,dozens
The struggle for that year's St. Leger was no sooner over than it was alleged there had been foul play in connection with the race_ and there is * probability that the allegation was not unfounded_ and that Mameluke was \"prevented\" from winning the race—a species of \"turf tactics\" not unknown even at present_ and occasionally resorted to when other modes of \"getting at\" a horse_ or his trainer_ or jockey_ do not prove successful.,great,directly,Newcastle-on-Tyne,defeated
The chicanery of the turf is varied in its action when the animal itself can be \"doctored_\" that of course makes certain the \"nobbled\" horse * lose a pail of water—\"just a real hearty drink\" (as a well-known northern trainer used to say)—given to the animal a little time before the race falls to be run_ generally_ but not always_ ensures defeat.,will,1806,Pre-engagements,tour
Other means of \"doctoring\" a racehorse are sometimes resorted to_ it being always a safer plan to make the horse \"right\" than to depend upon a jockey to \"pull it_\" as riders whose * intention has been suspected have been changed at the last moment_ and the horse_ being entrusted to the guidance of an honest jockey_ may win instead of losing the race.,evil,Sphynx,instance,course
In the case of Matilda_ it has been stated that the starter was the guilty party—that_ in fact_ he had been bribed to give his signal to \"go\" when it would be least advantageous to * Gully's horse_ which_ being a restless_ irritable animal_ contributed much to the tactics of the opposition by its fractiousness at the starting-post.,Mr.,newspaper,rendered,c
The winner of the race was the property of Mr. Petre_ who has been mentioned as being a patron of Robert *_ and in all probability that person was the engineer of the opposition to Gully's horse.,Ridsdale,pay—notwithstanding,Lake,excepted
The two ultimately became partners_ or \"confederates_\" in a good many of the turf events of their day but it is quite clear they were not acting in concert at Doncaster on * occasion of the St. Leger of 1827. At what date a formal partnership—if any such ever existed—was entered upon by Ridsdale and Gully is not known_ but it is more than likely they had on some occasions \"worked the oracle\" together for their mutual advantage before the period of their partnership.,the,scanned,resisted,classic

His machinations were far-reaching_ some of them taking a long time to mature but when such events came off they generally resulted in the right way for Ridsdale_ who was reputed at the time (1824) to have planned a way of * a very large sum of money over the race for the St. Leger of that year.,winning,failures,hackney,Leicester

Jerry_ the winner of the St. Leger of 1824_ was the property of a Mr. Gascoigne_ a well-known sportsman of his day and * horse_ ridden by Benjamin Smith_ a famous jockey of his era_ beat twenty-two competitors in the great struggle for the Blue Ribbon of the North.,the,suitable,fatigue,confident
Jerry was to have been piloted in the race by one Edwards_ a horseman of that time_ but for good and sufficient reasons he was at the eleventh hour superseded in the saddle by * Smith_ as will presently be shown.,Benjamin,equanimity,animals,uttered
Croft_ the trainer of the horse_ was exceedingly confident of the ability of Jerry to win the St. Leger_ and did not keep his opinion a secret but_ whilst the animal was being wound up for the occasion and was known to be doing all that was required of him on his training ground_ pleasing both the owner and his friends by the style in which he did his morning *_ he was apparently an undoubted victim of the \"legs_\" who never tired of betting the odds against his chance of winning the race.,gallops,Salt,Fourth,650
All comers were readily accommodated_ so that in the course of a few weeks_ to the great astonishment * his trainer and owner_ tens of thousands were industriously laid against Jerry's chance of winning.,of,quotations,\"admirers\",ninety
That Ridsdale was the undoubted engineer of the * was in due time discovered and that he had found out_ as he thought_ a way of making Mr. Gascoigne's colt a \"safe one\" came to be known.,opposition,mangled,division,despondent
The trainer of the horse_ as the fierce market opposition to it progressed_ naturally enough became suspicious of foul play_ and in consequence watched the course of the betting with feverish anxiety_ but only to find_ as the day for the decision of the race waxed nearer_ * this colt was being more and more \"peppered\" by a certain clique of betting men.,that,Hastings—who,Arnull,real

Having visited the subscription rooms on the Monday before the race_ and listened once more to the babble of opposition to his colt_ Croft was proceeding after a long walk to his quarters_ when_ as he passed a toll on his road_ he witnessed the arrival of a carriage drawn by four *_ and while the vehicle was pulled up for a moment he recognised its occupants.,horses,Chaloner,ower,decreed

The partnership between them was not formed_ it is believed_ * about the year 1829-30. The two men were at all events intimately associated in the winning of the Derby of 1832 by St. Giles_ and the winning of the St. Leger of the same year by Margrave.,till,general,seeming,been

Extraordinary revelations have occasionally been made of the amounts won by the confederates by means of St. Giles' victory both of them_ it is certain_ were large gainers by the success of their horse_ in favour of which the \"oracle\" is stated to have been so industriously \"worked\" that not more than three of the horses running in that year's Derby were * trying to win the horse placed third was Trustee_ the property of Ridsdale Margrave_ the fourth in the struggle_ belonged to Gully_ and afterwards won the St. Leger.,really,notions,family,tried

In that year's Derby there would probably be half-a-dozen horses which might have proved more or less dangerous to St. Giles but by some means or other—money_ in fact—the owners of these animals_ or their trainers or jockeys_ would be gained over by the confederacy_ at a cost_ perhaps_ for the half-dozen_ of some twenty * five-and-twenty thousand pounds.,or,pleasure,Area,Streatham
As a matter of course_ St. Giles had been used simply as an instrument of gambling as a two-year-old_ his quality as a race-horse had been hidden by his having undoubtedly been \"pulled\" in his earlier races_ so that when the day of his victory arrived_ the odds against his * might be large enough to make it worth the while of his owner to let him run.,chance,slabs,sheep,afforded
Margrave_ the St. Leger winner_ as has been stated_ ran fourth in the Derby but probably that horse was good enough to have won the Epsom trophy_ had St. Giles not been on duty but_ had * done so_ the odds against its winning the St. Leger would not have been anything like 8 to 1_ the price quoted at the start for the great Doncaster trophy.,it,trying,(?),long-distance

At the time indicated (1820 to 1845)_ the parishes * St. George's and St. James' swarmed with gambling-houses_ where large or small sums of money could nightly be gained or lost_ as might happen_ and the play at the majority of such houses was well known to fall out largely against the players_ as by many well-planned devices the bankers had points in their favour.,of,\"lot,receives—it,egotistical

Coming back to the doings of my hero_ it has to be stated with regard to Crockford that_ although at one period he was in possession of a stud of race-horses_ among the lot being Sultan_ which made some mark on the turf_ he never took a great amount of interest in the noble animal_ preferring to regard it_ like many other men_ as an instrument of gambling but the owner of the St. James' * was well versed in turf chicanery of all kinds_ and knew in his day most of the prominent spirits of the racing world.,gambling-house,cruel,distributed,requisite

Another branch of turf business which Crockford conducted at one time was that of \"squaring\" the books of smaller betting men than himself he could always be relied upon_ even at the last moment—that is_ immediately before a race—to lay the odds against such horses as a bookmaker was \"bad\" against_ and required therefore to back back again_ so as not to run greater risk * was compatible with an honest desire to meet engagements_ and pay what was seen to be due after the race was determined.,than,governs,holds,lady

What was generally resolved upon to begin * was_ that each of those present should_ a month before the race_ find out by means of a formal trial his best horse for the handicap at the published weights next_ that in a couple of days thereafter the three should be tried together along with the best public horse they were able to buy or borrow to take part in the trial at a weight agreed upon.,with,rivalled,void—a,larger

The sayings and doings of the turf world in connection with \"the Lady Elizabeth Scandal\" formed the subject of newspaper comment to such an extent at * time_ that nearly every person in the habit of reading the public prints must have been somewhat familiar with the unhappy story_ which may be briefly retold in these pages.,the,selection,sanguine,exhibition
Lady Elizabeth belonged to the Marquis of Hastings_ * was at one time first favourite for the Derby won by Bluegown_ the property of Sir Joseph Hawley_ in 1868_ much to the astonishment of hundreds of persons who believed the Marquis's filly was \"sure to win.,and,Thornville,scrambles,time—just
\" Lady Elizabeth_ during her * career_ had never but once known defeat_ as can be seen by referring to the turf chronicles of 1867_ in which year the value of the stakes won by her reached a total of £9_665.

No sooner had the struggle for the Blue Ribbon of 1868 been decided—in which Lady Elizabeth was nearer last than first_ although she started the undoubted favourite for the event with odds of 7 to 4 betted against her chance—than persons began to shake their heads and give utterance to the usual stereotyped remarks germane to such occasions_ as_ \"I told you *_ \"A rank stiff one_\" \"What a scandal_\" and so forth.,so\",instigation,path,puzzle
In plain language_ it was assumed by a large section of the public that Lady Elizabeth had never been intended to win the Derby_ but that_ on the contrary_ the mare had been for months an abject \"market horse_\" and that thousands of pounds had been invested on the animal for the benefit of the Marquis and his aiders and abettors in the fraud that all connected with Lady Elizabeth_ from her owner down to * boy who every morning removed the litter from her stall_ had made fortunes by means of the milking pail which had been in such constant requisition! Moreover it was currently stated among numerous reports circulated that Admiral Rous had asserted that the mare_ just previous to the race_ had been heavily drugged with laudanum but the Admiral_ in a letter to  newspaper under the date of June 15th_ 1868_ gave an emphatic contradiction to that report.,the,25th,expenditure,themselves
In continuation_ the Admiral went on to say \"My belief is that Lady Elizabeth had a rough spin with Athena in March_ when the Days discovered she had lost her form—a very common occurrence with fillies severely trained at two years old that when the discovery was made they reversed a commission to back her for the One Thousand Guineas at Newmarket and they declared that Lord Hastings would not bring her out before the Derby_ on * he stood to win a great stake.,which,Shepherd,head,charger

In seeking after turf reform_ it must be borne in mind that there are some things which the Jockey Club cannot possibly accomplish but it is undoubtedly the province of that body to regulate racing so far as the ages of horses are concerned they can determine when two-year-olds shall first run_ and they can fix a limit_ as indeed they have already done_ below which the stake to * run for shall not sink.,be,never-ceasing,\"stable,care

One writer says it was during the reign of George II_ another tells us the Club was constituted between the years 1750 and 1760_ when a few gentlemen interested in the sport of horse-racing_ * who_ moreover_ were in the habit of riding their own horses_ banded themselves together_ and became founders of the tribunal which at present governs the \"sport of kings.,and,Clothworker,£3000000,business—have

The first official mention of the Club occurs in Heber's Racing Calendar for 1758_ under the heading of \"Orders_\" given for the purpose * compelling riders to weigh when they came in from running their horses in a race_ on pain of being dismissed_ which order is signed by Lord March and other noblemen and gentlemen then members of the institution.,of,discover,afflict,you
In an excellent_ although brief_ sketch of the history of the Club contributed to the \"Badminton Library_\" we are told that tradition points to its origin in the year 1750_ before which time the usual meeting-place for gentlemen attending * was the \"Red Lion Inn_\" the site of which is supposed to have been on the present Station Road.,Newmarket,sly,Yearlings?,necessity
In *_ the subscription-room was built_ and it may be taken for granted that the Club would then be formed_ or had been formed a little time previously.,1752,commissioner,beat,accepted

Strictly speaking_ the Jockey Club had no authority or power to extend or enforce the observance of their laws at any other meetings than those held at Newmarket but it soon became evident that a uniform and general application of its rules or laws * desirable_ and therefore by a sort of tacit understanding it gradually became customary for all race meetings of importance to place themselves under the laws of the Jockey Club by a general consent and acknowledgment of its authority.,was,because,Derby\",turf
In many cases_ however_ there was a doubt respecting the extent and power of application of the said laws_ and therefore_ in 1831_ the Jockey Club notified that their rules and orders applied to Newmarket _ but they recommended their adoption to the stewards of other races_ and in places where they were publicly adopted and recognised the Jockey Club would investigate and decide on disputes submitted to them for adjudication_ but * otherwise.,not,severity,deceive,run

I am indebted for these remarks which_ so far_ indicate the rise of the Jockey Club to power_ to an anonymous volume published in 1863_ which contains many observations on the powers and duties of the Club_ and the mode in which they ought to be carried into execution_ the object of the commentator being to point out how wonderful a circumstance it is that * whole racing community can be held in check by a self-constituted body.,the,blood—a,till,24th

Considerable sums of money are * derived from charges of admission made at various stands and enclosures pertaining to the different racecourses_ and these are being multiplied by order of the Club_ which seems to be fashioning racing on the Heath pretty much in the same way as if the meetings held under its auspices were gate-money meetings.,also,wherever,Smithfield,control

In truth_ looking up as the sporting public do to this body as the chief and sovereign head of their own community for either approbation * condemnation_ and with such serious obligations on their own part_ and weighty and grave matters to deal with and adjudicate upon as regards others_ it behoves them to be careful in their own actions_ and tender in investigating and deciding upon the action of others.,or,33,Iroquois,nowadays

The jurisdiction of the Jockey Club will always_ in my opinion_ be incomplete till it accepts the responsibility of laying down the law in questions as to disputed bets_ and of deciding when horses are in a race or when they are not as_ for instance_ * the case of Maskelyne_ about which there was a few years ago much discussion_ resulting in the illogical conclusion that_ although the entry of that horse was informal_ and consequently inept_ those who backed it were ordered by the committee of Tattersall's to pay their bets! Why should it be possible to make an informal entry of any horse for any race? Hitherto it appears to have been among the unwritten laws of the turf that any person might enter any animal he pleased in any way he liked_ without let or hindrance_ and any one can still do so_ and thus open a wide door to fraud.,in,Vallance,games,wind
To promote the interest of bookmakers possessing a dishonest turn_ half-a-dozen * might be entered for important races.,Maskelynes,bills,title,1.
Such entries_ no doubt_ as in the case of the horse named_ may hitherto have been accidental but in future such entries might be made all but impossible by being brought_ by order of the Club_ under the cognisance of some responsible official whose duty it should be to oversee all entries and * the age and breeding of the animals submitted for the various races.,check,stall,contempt,forward
