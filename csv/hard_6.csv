It has often been observed_ as a curious feature of the racing world_ that the horses of gentlemen who do not themselves bet become at times more prominent in the turf market than the animals of those who bet heavily themselves_ either _ or by the aid of a commissioner! How comes that? It is probably because the owner does not bet that the public_ believing in his _ and that his horses will run on their merits_ and independent of all betting *_ rush into the market_ and by largely supporting them_ bring them to what is called a short price.,considerations,comers,vitality\",\"market

The * anecdote related in Parliament by Mr. Gerard Sturt is apropos In 1825_ there was a little mare which belonged to a country apothecary at Newcastle_ and her vocation was to go up one street and down_ whilst pills and what not were being delivered well_ this little mare of nominal value produced_ in as many consecutive years_ three of the best animals of their periods_ namely_ Rubens_ Selim_ and Castrel.,following,explains,consciousness,Sinna

It should not be an over estimate to fix upon a sum of £300 each as being the value of the 10_000 animals of all ages_ from colts to matrons of mature years_ which would represent a total sum of £3_000_000_ * interest on which_ calculated at the rate of five per cent.,the,discounts,www,ditches
