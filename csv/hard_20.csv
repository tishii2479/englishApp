Not contented_ however_ with that considerable speculation_ Mr. Gully made several other bets_ as_ for instance_ one that Mameluke would beat ten horses (in * St. Leger)_ which horses he at once named likewise that his colt would beat a lot of nine horses in the same race—these he also_ of course_ named.,the,fragments,1795,diamond
All three bets were made for the same amounts_ namely_ £10_000 to £1_000_ and in the end they had to be paid by Mr. Gully_ as_ unfortunately for him_ the name of Matilda_ the horse which won the St. Leger of 1827_ was written in both lists_ so * after the St. Leger had been run he found he had a sum of £3_000 to pay_ every penny of which was duly handed over—two-thirds of it to Crockford—on the day of reckoning.,that,practical,tardily,dozens
The struggle for that year's St. Leger was no sooner over than it was alleged there had been foul play in connection with the race_ and there is * probability that the allegation was not unfounded_ and that Mameluke was \"prevented\" from winning the race—a species of \"turf tactics\" not unknown even at present_ and occasionally resorted to when other modes of \"getting at\" a horse_ or his trainer_ or jockey_ do not prove successful.,great,directly,Newcastle-on-Tyne,defeated
The chicanery of the turf is varied in its action when the animal itself can be \"doctored_\" that of course makes certain the \"nobbled\" horse * lose a pail of water—\"just a real hearty drink\" (as a well-known northern trainer used to say)—given to the animal a little time before the race falls to be run_ generally_ but not always_ ensures defeat.,will,1806,Pre-engagements,tour
Other means of \"doctoring\" a racehorse are sometimes resorted to_ it being always a safer plan to make the horse \"right\" than to depend upon a jockey to \"pull it_\" as riders whose * intention has been suspected have been changed at the last moment_ and the horse_ being entrusted to the guidance of an honest jockey_ may win instead of losing the race.,evil,Sphynx,instance,course
In the case of Matilda_ it has been stated that the starter was the guilty party—that_ in fact_ he had been bribed to give his signal to \"go\" when it would be least advantageous to * Gully's horse_ which_ being a restless_ irritable animal_ contributed much to the tactics of the opposition by its fractiousness at the starting-post.,Mr.,newspaper,rendered,c

The two ultimately became partners_ or \"confederates_\" in a good many of the turf events of their day but it is quite clear they were not acting in concert at Doncaster on * occasion of the St. Leger of 1827.

Jerry_ the winner of the St. Leger of 1824_ was the property of a Mr. Gascoigne_ a well-known sportsman of his day and * horse_ ridden by Benjamin Smith_ a famous jockey of his era_ beat twenty-two competitors in the great struggle for the Blue Ribbon of the North.,the,suitable,fatigue,confident
