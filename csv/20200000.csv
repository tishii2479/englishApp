Some of the details of this * (told by a Muhammadan writer) are probably quite untrue.,story,collected,us,inside

He himself belonged to the family which took the lead in religious matters in Arabia_ he had always been made much of_ and told he would be a great man he used to have fits which seemed to him and to others to mark him out as something out of the common so it is not surprising that he at last came to believe that * was to be the new Arabian prophet who seemed to him to be so badly wanted.,he,aside,ones,too—straightened
