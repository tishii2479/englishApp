Apropos to betting for cash_ one of the most singular utterances that has ever appeared against the \"principle\" of betting for ready money is that of Mr. William Day_ * in one of the monthly miscellanies_ and in which he describes that mode of betting as a \"pernicious system_\" as \"the greatest pest of society_ the current evil of the day.,published,Robe,furlongs),\"points\"
\" Further_ Mr. Day says the practice of ready money betting is \"a blot on the nationality * every Englishman!\" Unfortunately for himself_ Mr. Day stultifies his own arguments against ready money betting by his advocacy of the Pari-mutuel plan of backing horses_ which is a ready money system of betting _ the adoption of which Mr. Day thinks would put a stop to reckless speculation_ as_ indeed_ would ready money betting conducted through the medium of the bookmakers (who ought to be licensed).,of,\"Her,handicap,imperative
The writer of these pages_ as is obvious enough_ is quite of the * opinion as Mr. Day_ that \"so long as a man can go into the ring and bet his untold thousands upon race after race_ not having as many hundreds to pay his losses with_ so long as he can find usurers to supply him with the needful to be paid on the Monday after_ then so long_ too_ will he continue to bet_ little caring what he pays for the convenience as things are he is compelled to raise funds to save his credit and his respect among his aristocratic associates_ but in the other case (of Pari-mutuel betting) there would not be such pressing necessity for him to have the money.,same,1606,payer,instead
