The above copy of the rubric shows what the movements made to reform the Derby Stakes have resulted in—namely_ the ensuring of a fixed sum to the owner of the winner_ as also a gratuity to the breeder of the victorious horse_ but no increased allowance is to be given to the animal which comes in second the third *_ however_ will now get £200 instead of £150.

Not till 1831 did the entry in any year exceed one hundred horses so that up to that date_ if all the subscribers paid their money_ the value of the Derby—the figure was greatly dependent_ of course_ on the number of horses that came to the starting-post—would * seldom reach a sum of £3_000. Not till George Fordham steered Mr. Acton's Sir Bevys to victory in 1879 did the stake reach its highest value_ when_ with 278 entries and 22 runners_ the sum must have amounted to £7_500_ if all who entered their colts paid their stakes.,very,engineer,Foundation,\"Please
* long before that son of Favonius had placed the Blue Ribbon of the Turf to the credit of his owner_ the Epsom Summer Meeting had been placed on a thoroughly business footing_ such a footing as has secured for many years a magnificent dividend to the proprietors of the grand stand_ who are lessees of the course on which the Derby_ Oaks_ and other races have for so many years been run but it has been said that so far as the gentlemen of England—who run colts in the Derby or fillies in the Oaks—and their foreign friends are concerned_ they might as well write the names of their horses on pieces of paper_ and shaking them together in a hat_ select at random the first three and divide the money in accordance with the result of the draw.,But,\"Let,outspoken,postman

As was recently said by a popular writer_ the race for the Derby still * tens of thousands of people to Epsom to see it decided but for all that it is thought by persons well qualified to offer an opinion that the great race has begun to decline_ and that_ unless those most interested in its popularity—namely_ the lessees of the racecourse—take immediate steps to increase the value of the stake run for to a still greater extent than has been yet done the entries will diminish.,attracts,Pretty,rid,public
