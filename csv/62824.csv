Still more odd was * that the pantry should also be similarly furnished with means of observation.,it,aeronaut,buy,spite
To prevent undue notice of his own movements_ Mr. Trace had furnished his peepholes with small discs of cardboard_ with * he covered them when he required a light in his room.,which,apartment,assistants,wonted

His transaction with Mr. Torrens was the first for which he felt the law might have a legitimate * upon him.,grip,robbery,formed,yours
But as the steward had evidently been officiating as spy_ or detective_ whichever he might like to call himself_ before the occurrence * the little scene just alluded to_ it was clear that this was not the cause of the stranger’s presence on board.,of,profitable,outside,beating

\"So this is the dreaded Bay of Biscay again_\" said Mrs. Colbrook_ * stout_ good-humoured-looking lady.,a,beyond,earnest,sharing

As Miss Stratton talked to her dog_ * patted and caressed him_ and altogether treated him as if he could understand every word she said.,she,mastless,goodhumouredlooking,christened

Then he laid himself beside * door and watched the transformation which his mistress soon began to make in her appearance.,the,recovered,haggard,closely
Truth to say_ the change effected was sufficiently startling to deceive even the keenest observer_ and perhaps Briny himself would have been at fault if he had not been already initiated into * of his owner’s curious habits.,some,otherwise,convince,sisterinlaw
In about an hour Miss Stratton was nowhere to be seen_ and in * place stood the young gentleman who has been introduced to the reader as Mr. Bootle.,her,relate,hesitatingly,exertions

Then he raised * blind and looked out of the window.,the,detective,preoccupied,died

Before * the garden_ however_ after closing the window_ Mr. Bootle reconnoitred a little_ for he had an idea that Mrs. Dollman’s dining-room had a window which overlooked this part of the premises.,leaving,clings,shudderingly,consideration
The supposition proved quite correct_ and what was equally important was * fact that the window was not too closely blinded.,the,injustice,ascertained,sighs

\"There now_ Mr. S._ I have got a good look at you *_\" was the inward comment of the unseen watcher.,unobserved,villain,descent,spending
Five minutes later * friend_ cigarette in hand_ was promenading carelessly up and down the front street_ and keeping a sharp look-out upon Mrs. Dollman’s door.,our,item,certainly,impulsive
It was half-past nine when at last his vigil was rewarded * the sight he hoped for.,by,saved,illumination,cigarette

Mr. Bootle_ otherwise Annie Cory_ felt a slight accession of nervousness on entering the hotel to which Mr. Staines hurried as if he were afraid of missing some of the * going on inside.,fun,lace,life,tale
But_ although Annie found herself entering upon a totally new phase of life_ she sauntered through the vestibule_ and * a large saloon behind Staines_ as if she were quite used to the habits of the society to which she was now being introduced.,into,dealing,identity,opinion
Following the * of her unconscious guide_ she seated herself at a small table_ and ordered a drink of brandy.,example,height,blot,myself
Her reason for ordering brandy was * apparent.,soon,attire,dismayed,edge

In this way she fairly accounted for her presence in the place * appearing to be an unprofitable customer.,without,each,happier,desperation
Her next proceeding was to follow Mr. Staines into a side-room_ in the centre of which stood a table_ round which were seated some men playing * cards.,at,cannot,overcome,effected
The game was being watched by about a score of onlookers_ and it was easy to stand * them and elude special observation.,among,down,contact,approval
Mr. Staines_ although * luck was almost miraculous_ seemed to have as yet aroused no suspicions of unfair play.,his,imprisonment,experienced,capable
Now and again he lost a trifle_ but Mr. Bootle concluded that these occasional losses were * effected solely for the purpose of preserving the confidence and stimulating the gambling propensities of the people whose money the unscrupulous fellow meant to win.,deliberately,truest,endowed,dismissed
\"I think I will * it_\" said Mr. Staines at last_ putting his winnings into his pocket.,drop,things,trying,murder
But this show of consideration for others had precisely the * anticipated by the speaker.,effect,discreetness,breast,whenever
The majority of his hearers were English_ and they did not relish the imputation of unskilfulness thus adroitly * upon them.,thrown,preserving,openly,dastard
\"No_ sir_\" said a tall_ military-looking *_ whose eyes were already bright between the excitement of play and the worship of Bacchus.,man,usually,poverty,sought
There was an immediate chorus of approval from * onlookers to whom the speaker appealed.,the,matches,affairs,substantial

\"Nothing of the sort_\" shouted a half-tipsy individual_ * outward appearance gave very little indication of the nature of his profession or pursuits.,whose,individuals,understand,foppishly
The speaker looked big enough and brawny enough to imbue his hearers with the belief that he was quite * to carry out his threat.,able,enthusiastically,perhaps,wildest
His utterances were therefore received with something like * respect they merited by all but the fast young sub.,the,spread,judges,negative
\"No_ *_\" was the immediate verdict.,no,establishment,luxuries,accent
So_ presently_ * game was resumed with increased zest_ and small bets as to the results were indulged in_ while glasses were emptied and replenished with a beautiful disregard of the probable effects of their contents upon the system.,the,traced,contrived,breach
Mr. Bootle had made occasional feints of drinking_ but could not help being amused to see how easy it was to substitute an empty glass for his own_ * arousing the suspicions of those who profited by the change.,without,consolation,loth,endeavours
The babel of voices_ the frequent oaths_ the tobacco-laden atmosphere_ were all * to Mr. Bootle’s ideas of comfort.,antagonistic,sometime,probably,interrupted

His own glance betrayed some nervousness_ for he never lost sight of the * of being tracked by the friends of Harley Riddell.,possibility,uneasy,promised,yesterday

Shortly after this_ Gregory Staines joined the individual * sauntered in the same direction_ which chanced to be homewards for both of them_ although the former little dreamed how closely his fate was linked with that of his companion.,who,suspected,shake,brave

Then he bade him good-bye for * nonce_ went round to the garden_ and soon reached the room allotted to Miss Una Stratton_ where he received a warm_ but silent welcome from Briny_ who had kept faithful vigil.,the,discoveries,taken,ostensibly

As she concluded this reflection Miss Stratton raised her eyes_ as * furtively_ to Mr. Staines’s face_ and then glanced down again_ apparently in sudden confusion.,if,bobbed,rise,arrested

After this Mr. Staines would fain have * talking to Una.,continued,accident,rapidly,emphasised

As Miss Stratton spoke_ with such apparent * of Phœbe’s feelings_ she darted an admiring and meaning look at Gregory Staines_ which at once put that gentleman at his ease again for a little while.,disregard,popular,today,healthy
\"The little fool has * that the artist is more in my line_ and is jealous_\" he mused.,seen,island,gazed,steadily
In pursuance of this train of thought_ Mr. Staines * very solicitous about Mrs. Dollman’s state of health_ smiled quite tenderly at her_ suggested that she should lie down to compose her nerves_ and offered to take all the labours of carving off her hands.,became,recapitulation,losing,ensures
