The arrangement usually made was that the more responsible country bookmakers_ _ those in the larger provincial towns and cities_ should be communicated with_ and be asked to lay the odds against \"so and so\" to a specific amount and at a given price_ or no limit might be given in the matter of price but a particular hour was generally named at which the commission * desired to be executed by the bookmaker or other appointed agent_ so that all the money required was usually obtained by this plan of doing the work.,was,back,hack,married
In the course of a day it would become known that a very heavy commission had been worked on behalf of \"so and so_\" for the \"such and such\" handicap_ and in consequence the odds against that horse would be quoted at a rapidly lessening figure_ much to the chagrin of those who had laid the larger * longer rates of odds_ and who_ awakening to what had happened_ were desirous themselves of backing the horse so as to lessen the sum they would require to pay in the event of its winning the race it had been backed for.,or,roots,flatly,elapsed

That being so_ a heavy commission was executed at the * of Mr. Merry_ and so much was the horse's chance esteemed both by owner and commissioner_ despite the heavy weight he had to carry_ that still more money was put on his chance but in spite of the well-known fact that Mr. Merry had backed Chanticleer to win a big sum_ his price in the market never \"shortened_\" which being contrary to the usual state of affairs_ caused Mr. Swindell a great deal of uneasiness.,request,delightful,profit,McGrath

Ridsdale was fortunate_ as the saying goes_ to get into many of the \"good things\" of those days_ and_ judging by the * establishment he was speedily enabled to set up in the neighbourhood of York_ he must_ almost at the outset of his turf career_ have discovered a way of \"making\" large sums of money.,fine,scene,crop,fought

It was while carrying on business as a publican that Gully saw his way to fortune in the betting ring like some other shrewd persons_ he early discovered that \"backing\" horses was an unprofitable *_ having come to the conclusion that the chief gains of the turf remained in the hands of the men who laid the odds.,avocation,supreme,(1873),offerings

The commissions with which he was so frequently entrusted showed Gully what were the expectations of owners_ and not only which horses might win_ but also some as well which were sure to be beaten because on the turf there was then_ as there is now_ two kinds of \"commissions\"—one to back a given horse_ or it might be two or three horses_ for the same event_ the other to * against animals meant to lose.,lay,feature,withheld,DAMAGES

Gully_ gathering experience day by day_ was soon able to play a prominent part in the heavy speculations which formed a feature of the turf in those times and whenever he thought any commission entrusted to him was a really good one—that is to say_ as denoting the chance of the horse to win—he followed the lead of his employer_ and by doing so often won considerable sums whilst if he knew_ as he * did_ that a horse was sure to be beaten_ he would spiritedly lay the odds against its chance of winning.,frequently,declared,www,trumpet
