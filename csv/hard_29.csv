The \"Rules of Racing_\" which have for a long period given law to the turf_ and the code of honour pertaining thereto which all racing * respect and obey_ have been from time to time revised and made more perfect by the Jockey Club_ which numbers at the present time about one hundred members_ and makes itself felt through the stewards_ to whom_ for all practical purposes_ its powers are delegated.,men,Ratan,beings,Middlesex
During their period of office_ to which they are nominated by their predecessors_ the stewards address those who are interested in the sport * horse-racing through the official \"Calendar_\" which is published in London by the Messrs.,of,liquor),wishing,wealthy
*_ of Old Burlington Street_ who may be termed the mouthpiece of the Club.,Weatherby,distance,plaintiff,Commodious

By payment of a slight commission on such transactions as take place_ gentlemen are saved the trouble which pertains to receiving stakes they may win_ or of paying personally such entry-money and forfeits as may have been incurred in the races they have been entrusted by clients to enter * in.,horses,mostly,25th,stirred
The gentlemen * keep a record of sportsmen who_ for various reasons_ prefer to pursue their career on the turf under an assumed name as also a register of the racing liveries or \"colours\" selected by owners to be worn by their jockeys_ and of these about nine hundred different arrangements are annually chronicled.,likewise,restrict,dream,\"metallician\"

The \"Rules of Racing\" are * the work of the Club.,entirely,\"through,3,telling
For the information of persons who have * been behind the scenes_ these rules may be here briefly glanced at.,never,successes,mint,repurchased
They provide for all the contingencies which may be expected to occur during the progress of sport these are so well provided for_ indeed_ that if a * meet with an accident or be killed at the winning-post_ provision is made for his being carried to the scales to be weighed.,jockey,remembered,Guineas,nearer
* explicit date is set down when flat racing shall begin and end in each year.,An,unremitting,terminates,race—\"scratch
The powers bestowed on the stewards of the different race meetings throughout the country are generally defined the gathering has to be under their direction_ * must regulate the conduct of all officials and persons coming to the meeting on business—that is_ trainers_ jockeys_ and others.,they,terminated,\"Burglar,\"charotte\"
The power of punishing evil-doers is vested * the stewards_ who may fine or suspend any person in fault.,in,comparison,newly,pithily
Stewards of meetings_ it is commanded in the \"Rules of Racing_\" shall exclude from the stands_ and other places under their control_ every person who has been \"warned off\" Newmarket Heath_ persons who are in the unpaid forfeit list_ also every jockey suspended for corrupt * on the turf_ while as a means of ensuring good order at meetings it is ordained by the \"Rules of Racing\" that \"the clerk of the course_ or corresponding official_ shall be the sole person responsible to the stewards for the general arrangement of the meeting_\" a clause evidently devised to bring some kind of machinery to bear for the exclusion of roughs and welshers from the racecourses of the kingdom.,practices,1891),\"use,Drayton
The following remarks will be generally accepted as being greatly to the point \"If an individual member of the turf suffers * pecuniary wrong_ it is the Jockey Club to whom he applies for redress and should his honour be assailed_ he places his reputation before the same authority for vindication.,a,per,gutenberg,belonged
In truth_ looking up as the sporting public do to this body as the chief and sovereign head of their own community for either approbation * condemnation_ and with such serious obligations on their own part_ and weighty and grave matters to deal with and adjudicate upon as regards others_ it behoves them to be careful in their own actions_ and tender in investigating and deciding upon the action of others.,or,33,Iroquois,nowadays
To have the moral right of sitting in judgment upon and deciding a question of honour with respect to others_ they must themselves be beyond * as reflected in their own character and actions but their verdict can never be impeached as long as in their own persons they set an example to others of high and honourable conduct.,reproach,weather,contact,admiration
The jurisdiction of the Jockey Club will always_ in my opinion_ be incomplete till it accepts the responsibility of laying down the law in questions as to disputed bets_ and of deciding when horses are in a race or when they are not as_ for instance_ * the case of Maskelyne_ about which there was a few years ago much discussion_ resulting in the illogical conclusion that_ although the entry of that horse was informal_ and consequently inept_ those who backed it were ordered by the committee of Tattersall's to pay their bets! Why should it be possible to make an informal entry of any horse for any race? Hitherto it appears to have been among the unwritten laws of the turf that any person might enter any animal he pleased in any way he liked_ without let or hindrance_ and any one can still do so_ and thus open a wide door to fraud.,in,Vallance,games,wind
To promote the interest of bookmakers possessing a dishonest turn_ half-a-dozen * might be entered for important races.,Maskelynes,bills,title,1.
Such entries_ no doubt_ as in the case of the horse named_ may hitherto have been accidental but in future such entries might be made all but impossible by being brought_ by order of the Club_ under the cognisance of some responsible official whose duty it should be to oversee all entries and * the age and breeding of the animals submitted for the various races.,check,stall,contempt,forward
With regard to bets_ it is notorious that in the case of disputes a really logical decision on the merits of a case * seldom be obtained.,can,November,tapis),company
Decisions are often given on what may be called a \"sentimental\" view of the subject it would not be difficult to cull from the annals * Tattersall's a string of judgments each of which would put the other out of countenance.,of,Match-making,limbs,pay
The committee to whom is confided the giving of a * in a case of disputed betting is too big.,decision,consequently,\"swells\",flutter
A very small tribunal_ always composed of the same men_ the consistency of whose decisions could be watched and discussed by those interested in the purity of * turf_ would act with such promptitude as would enable \"quorums\" to be dispensed with—the \"quorum\" system_ indeed_ might be advantageously done away with.,the,Godolphin,GUTENBERG-tm,Tuscany
The unique position occupied by the Jockey *_ which has been_ so far_ described for the benefit of the uninitiated_ is_ of course_ known to all interested in the business of racing.,Club,Parliament—crying,superfluous,ordained
The Club_ as lawgiver of the turf and as its own executive_ is despotic it makes laws and alters them at discretion the plain truth is_ it seems to be perpetually engaged in the patching of the \"Rules of Racing_\" which have been the growth of the last seventy or eighty years_ and which_ * of being occasionally patched_ ought to be revised from beginning to end—or_ perhaps_ if they were \"entirely reconstructed\" it would be better.,instead,Thatchem,Europe\",household
In * probability the original framework has been so patched as to be past recognition.,all,run,Honest,lookers-on
Any person who takes the trouble to * over the \"Rules of Racing_\" which are to be found in \"Ruff\" or any of the other guides to the turf_ will at once see that many of them might be with advantage altogether excised.,look,possessed,patrons,Any
The terrible penalties against horse-watching_ especially in regard to trials_ might at once be removed from the statutes as they stand they only provoke laughter in fact they are altogether obsolete_ and seem to * moderns \"full of sound and fury.,us,own\",vengeance,hue
The following sentences * the rules of racing_ so far as they relate to \"corrupt practices_\" among which will be found what is said in regard to the watching of trials \"(i.,comprise,Trainers,capacity,sir\"
) If any person corruptly give or offer any money_ share in a bet_ * other benefit to any person having official duties in relation to a race or to any jockey or (ii.,or,disappointment,token,parents

) Wilfully enter or cause to be entered or to start for any race a horse * he knows to be disqualified or (iv.,which,mortifying,unsuccessful,cheeky
) If any person be detected watching a trial_ or proved to the * of the stewards of the Jockey Club to have employed any person to watch a trial_ or to have obtained surreptitiously information respecting a trial from any person or persons engaged in it_ or in the service of the owner as trainer of the horses tried_ or respecting any horse in training from any person in such services or (v.,satisfaction,longer,tract,unfortunate
) If any person be * of any other corrupt or fraudulent practices on the turf in this or any other country every person so offending shall be warned off Newmarket Heath and other places where these rules are in force.,guilty,green,thread,\"Chester
These laws were evidently devised in favour of betting owners_ who cared little about racing * for the opportunities afforded for gambling.,except,1840,\"bill,1819
During these * years the Jockey Club has been criticised by several sporting writers with unsparing severity various faults incident to a pastime which within the last sixty or seventy years has developed into an immense institution of the gambling order having been improperly laid at its door.,latter,shop,admirably,soon
The Club_ or at all events the men who direct its work_ are not seldom held up to the * as \"anserous noodles\" of the deepest dye_ as \"men_ indeed_ who could not be entrusted to groom a horse_ far less to make laws for the regulation of horse-racing.,public,emanates,vouchsafed,22nd
\" Nothing comes easier to some writers when_ unfortunately for the public_ they are entrusted with the use of pen and ink_ than abuse but happily abuse is * argument_ and no writer desirous of seeing the turf in a flourishing condition_ or who is anxious to have its unsavoury surroundings eliminated_ can ignore the useful work done by the Club within the last ten or twelve years_ which may be assumed as the precursor of more good work to follow.,not,insert,horse—and,Music
What may_ however_ be very properly charged against the Jockey Club is that_ being a dealer in racing itself_ it is wrong for it to regulate the racing of other companies it is_ in reality_ as if one firm of tailors were to constitute itself the supreme head of the trade_ and say to all other tailors \"You shall do as I tell you you must cut your cloth as I dictate_ and * at the price I name.,sell,logic,Warwick,forth
\" The Club has in its day done much to further the interests of the turf_ but much remains yet for it to do—not so much_ however_ in the devising of big stakes to be run on its own race-ground_ but in various reforms incidental to race-running and * codifying and revising the laws of the turf.,in,respect,mutual,pictured
