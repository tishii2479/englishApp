She_ too_ has refused the orphan_ but now_ seeing no hope of a better bargain_ rather than have taken her journey for nothing_ she tells the old man she has changed her *_ and carries the baby home.,mind,gains,day’s,destitute
And the story runs that the thin weak donkey that could hardly drag itself along as * entered Mecca_ ran along so nimbly on the way home that the rest could scarcely keep up with it.,it,exceptional,easily,kneel

Some of the details of this story (told by a Muhammadan * are probably quite untrue.,writer),was,granddaughter,Probably
Little Muhammad’s grandfather was * to be very rich and in a very high position_ and if the baby was refused it was probably because he was a sickly child_ and would be difficult to rear.,known,copied,dictated,Kerbela

He himself belonged to the family which took the lead in religious matters in Arabia_ he had always been made much of_ and told he would be a great man he used to have fits which seemed to him and to others to mark him out as something out of the common so it is not surprising that he at last came to believe that he * to be the new Arabian prophet who seemed to him to be so badly wanted.,was,cross,faith,necessarily
