The author makes no pretensions to teach trainers how to train horses_ or jockeys how to ride them_ and in no sense_ except that it is offered for their perusal_ is the work intended for those who make the \"business\" of the turf the work of their lives; the book has been written for * persons and other purposes.,other,217,apparent,favouritism
It is necessary to state this much plainly_ because when a paper or an article pertaining to the \"great national sport\" appears in a review or magazine_ it is at once stigmatised by the sporting journals as containing only \"pipers' news_\" and in the view of the critics it may be so; but such articles are not written to instruct the critics_ but to inform * public.,the,retold,regulation,anticipated

It will_ perhaps_ be thought by some persons that the dark side of things is too much dwelt upon in the following pages_ that too much is said about the frauds and chicaneries of the turf_ and too little about the brighter aspects * the sport_ but it must be borne in mind that racing has unfortunately become a \"business\" of the most sordid kind; the majority of the men engaged in the \"sport\" run their horses only as \"instruments of gambling_\" whilst not a few of them to ensure success condescend to practices that will not bear the light of day.,of,1595,remote,\"profession\"

A remarkable set of rules for the guidance of those taking part in the competition for the original Town Plate was devised in this reign_ and_ as will be evident from the following extracts_ afforded a foundation for many of the rules of racing_ which afterwards came in * all over England.,use,regulate,£715.,disguise
One of the rules is worded as follows: \"Every horse that rideth shall be bridled_ saddled_ and shod_ and his rider shall weigh twelve stone_ fourteen pounds to the stone_ and every rider that wanteth above one pound and a half after he hath rid the heat_ * win no plate or prize.,shall,\"place\",eliminated,sell

Betting and \"turf profligacy\" of all kinds were in these times indulged in at * to an extent far beyond the bounds of morality and prudence_ and_ although King and Court were_ so to put it_ in \"the swim\" of all that occurred_ an Act of Parliament required to be passed to restrain gaming and betting on race-horses to an excessive amount \"on tick or credit.,Newmarket,Under,Mary,continuance

The preamble of this piece of legislation was decidedly couched in severe language; it asserted that all games and *_ when not used in an innocent and moderate manner_ encourage idleness and tend to a dissolute course of life_ and to the debauching of the nobility and gentry and others; to the loss of their precious time_ and the utter ruin of their estates and fortunes.,exercises,employed—so,keeping,delinquency

In a \"History of Horse-racing_\" published in 1863_ appears the following summary of the early history of the sport at Chester: \"In the year 1511_ the silver bell of the value of three shillings and fourpence was first run for as a prize; in 1609 or 1610_ the bell was converted into silver *_ the value of which is not stated_ and from this date the race was annually run for on the Rood Dee_ was then named and henceforth known as 'St  George's Race'; and in 1623 there was another alteration made in the prize run for_ as in that year the three cups were changed into 'one faire silver cupp_' of about the value of eight pounds.,'cupps',course,deposited,compelled

During a race meeting lasting over three or four days_ the handicapper finds plenty of work_ as_ in addition to having apportioned weights to all the horses engaged in the larger handicaps_ nurseries_ and sweepstakes_ many days_ in some cases *_ before the date of the meeting_ he has to adjust the weights for those races which are run from day to day_ for which horses are not entered till the evening before the day on which they are to run.,months,publicly,£1500,Morocco;

The duty of the starter_ more particularly when there is a large field of young horses (two-year-olds)_ is difficult to perform satisfactorily_ especially when the short distance to be run * five furlongs) is taken into account; it is of the utmost importance_ therefore_ that each horse shall start on equal terms.,(say,eleven,Barbarian,chagrin

Men with big studs usually strive to win the larger stakes_ but as these stakes are fewer in number and have more numerous competitors_ so their chances of success are proportionately lessened; but when a Cesarewitch_ Cambridgeshire_ or Manchester Autumn Cup is won_ the money gained even in stakes is worth adding to the owner's * account.,bank,horror,face,Egerton

The foregoing observations on the \"business\" of horse-racing may be fitly supplemented by a few additional remarks about the officers of the turf—chiefly with regard to former doings by these gentlemen_ whose positions * are less \"picturesque\" than they were half a century ago.,to-day,Coke,DAMAGES,handled
Various meetings are becoming nowadays hard to sustain_ and there is_ in some instances_ it is generally believed_ a * deal of begging on the part of the clerk of the course to get the requisite funds; in such cases that gentleman performs_ or used to perform_ a liberal share of the work.,good,Armada,Bless,evoked
It may be mentioned here that when on a particular occasion a Queen's Plate_ usually run for at the popular Scottish Musselburgh meeting_ was disallowed by Parliament_ at the instigation of a Radical member of the House of Commons_ the clerk of the course_ Mr. James Turner_ along with some friends_ conceived the idea of * the disallowed trophy by a \"People's Plate\" of the same value_ £100; a subscription was suggested_ and the requisite sum of money was obtained in the course of a day or two_ mostly in pence.,replacing,remunerative,advertiser,irritable

In one or two instances where the clerk of the course acted also as handicapper_ as well as being lessee of the grand stand_ it is said that it * his custom to \"retain\" all the big stakes; in plain language_ it has been more than once implied that some handicappers were allowed_ by certain owners_ to keep the stake-money_ on condition of the horses entered by them being favoured in the apportioning of the weights.,was,usual,Gown,held

At one period * turf history_ according to an authority already mentioned_ the duties of starter were so inefficiently performed that Lord George Bentinck_ who reformed many of the abuses incidental to the sport of kings_ used himself voluntarily to undertake the task of starting the horses whenever a great event was about to be decided.,of,hats,earlier,spiritedly

On one occasion ten false starts took place before the genuine race was run; that was in Altissidora's year (1813)_ when seventeen horses came under the charge of the starter.,all,Olympian,Lincoln,£25

It was named after the Earl of Derby when it was instituted in 1780_ but_ as has been *_ a long time elapsed before the afterwards great Epsom event became the popular meeting which it now is.,mentioned,fashions;,interest,him;
Not till 1831 did the entry in any year exceed one hundred horses; so that up to that date_ if all the subscribers paid their money_ the value of the Derby—the figure was greatly dependent_ of course_ on the number of horses that came to the starting-post—would very seldom reach a sum of £3_000. Not till George Fordham steered Mr. Acton's * Bevys to victory in 1879 did the stake reach its highest value_ when_ with 278 entries and 22 runners_ the sum must have amounted to £7_500_ if all who entered their colts paid their stakes.,Sir,began,painstaking,1783
But long before that son of Favonius had placed the Blue Ribbon of the Turf to the credit of his owner_ the Epsom Summer Meeting had been placed on a thoroughly business footing_ such a footing as has secured for many years a magnificent dividend to the proprietors of the grand stand_ who are lessees of the course on which the Derby_ *_ and other races have for so many years been run; but it has been said that so far as the gentlemen of England—who run colts in the Derby or fillies in the Oaks—and their foreign friends are concerned_ they might as well write the names of their horses on pieces of paper_ and shaking them together in a hat_ select at random the first three and divide the money in accordance with the result of the draw.,Oaks,stuff,hand;,stakes—should

The Cesarewitch cannot be said to be \"famous\" for its surroundings; on the contrary_ the struggle has often enough been accompanied by an evil odour of finesse and chicanery_ consequent on repeated attempts to throw dust in the eyes of the handicapper_ or_ to state more plainly what is meant_ to \"cheat\" * important functionary.,that,humour,injustice,recoup

The reason why such practices are resorted to is not because the stake which can be won is a valuable one_ as the total amount of the Cesarewitch Stakes seldom reaches *_ but because the race in question affords a medium of wagering on such a gigantic scale that horses entered for the contest may_ with caution_ be backed to win even as much as £100_000.

Previous even to the period I have been attempting to illustrate there was being published a regular racing circular_ the precursor of the  of a later period_ whilst newspaper tipping_ especially in the columns of certain of the London weekly newspapers_ was greatly extended; in not a few of them * \"real poet\" gushed forth his prophetic lore_ and_ as has been stated already_ not a few of the poetic predictions perpetrated some fifty years ago were exceedingly felicitous in their diction_ considering the sometimes very uncouth matter that had of necessity to be dealt with.,a,138,remarks,encourage

Nowadays every newspaper of importance has to furnish a daily modicum of sporting *_ which proprietors find to be a costly item in the ever increasing sum of their expenditure.,intelligence,probably,distinguishing,fighters
But it is a circumstance that cannot be helped; there is in reality more interest taken in the handicaps for the Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire by five-sixths of the readers of the daily papers than there is in all the other items of news added together; indeed_ it is not going too far to affirm that two or three of the daily newspapers are indebted for the larger portion of their sales to the * of their giving every morning a detailed programme for the races of the day_ as well as other sporting intelligence.,fact,Whispers,intermittent,Martin's

In addition to the racing news contained in the ordinary run of newspapers_ there are three daily journals published all the year round which are solely devoted to sporting news_ and these papers deal of course in \"tips_\" and some of them afford a place in their columns to a full score of the daily increasing army of vaticinators; and yet_ as must be patent to those who devote time and attention to the study of such matters_ no betting man could possibly make a fortune_ or even earn a *_ by abjectly following either or all of the honest newspaper tipsters referred to.,living,organisation;,excuses,1795-6

No data exists * show when the professional bookmaker as we know him came upon the scene; but it may be taken for granted that the \"penciller\" was not evolved at once_ but that the system grew by means of what it fed on_ originating_ doubtless_ in the practice adopted by certain gentlemen who_ having made a series of bets_ were anxious in consequence to get \"round_\" as the process of hedging is called_ or_ in other words_ to be in a position not to lose their money_ or_ to put the matter still more explicitly_ to possess a fair chance of winning something and losing nothing.,to,repeated,large,From

Several of the gentlemen who owned race-horses soon discovered that the mere winning * a stake by means of any particular race_ however large the sum run for might be_ did not reimburse them for the outlays which they had to make by keeping a stud of horses; hence the horse became an instrument of gambling_ and remains so at the present time.,of,behalf,\"mere,£15

* the average of the courses decided at Altcar_ a brace of greyhounds will keep the bettor in suspense for six minutes or so_ and when it is considered_ in the case of a stake in which sixty-four dogs take part_ six races must be run before the backer of a dog to win the Cup can receive his money_ it will be sufficiently obvious that very long odds ought to be obtained against those dogs which take part in the struggle.,On,concludes,busily,\"Only

It is not sometimes a very easy matter to invest a large sum on a comparatively small race_ and in connection with the mounts of the more popular jockeys the investment of £320 would not often cover previous losses; it might happen on occasion that £100 would require to be risked to win £30_ * that in the event cited a loss of over £224 would be sustained on the run of six non-successful mounts in the sequence_ and it is needless to say that a series of such misfortunes would speedily exhaust a pretty well-filled bank.,so,\"Just,request,Eglinton's

Apropos to betting for cash_ one of the most singular utterances that has ever appeared against the \"principle\" of betting for ready money is that of Mr. William Day_ published in one of the monthly miscellanies_ and in which he describes that mode of betting as a \"pernicious system_\" as \"the greatest pest * society_ the current evil of the day.,of,tribunal,\"Descriptions\",\"they
\" Further_ Mr. Day says the practice of ready money betting is \"a blot on the nationality of every Englishman!\" Unfortunately for himself_ Mr. Day stultifies his own arguments against ready money betting by his advocacy of the Pari-mutuel plan of backing horses_ which is a ready money system of betting *_ the adoption of which Mr. Day thinks would put a stop to reckless speculation_ as_ indeed_ would ready money betting conducted through the medium of the bookmakers (who ought to be licensed).,,Benjamin,reward,decree
The writer of these pages_ as is obvious enough_ is quite of the same opinion as Mr. Day_ that \"so long as a * can go into the ring and bet his untold thousands upon race after race_ not having as many hundreds to pay his losses with_ so long as he can find usurers to supply him with the needful to be paid on the Monday after_ then so long_ too_ will he continue to bet_ little caring what he pays for the convenience; as things are he is compelled to raise funds to save his credit and his respect among his aristocratic associates_ but in the other case (of Pari-mutuel betting) there would not be such pressing necessity for him to have the money.,man,horse,August,proposed

He had formed an extensive * profitable acquaintance with many of the northern trainers and jockeys_ who at the period_ say from 1815 onwards_ were busy in the racing world; the sport of kings at the time indicated being in a flourishing condition in the North_ where the training stables were crowded with famous horses_ the riders of which had earned reputations on the turf.,and,sanguine,William's,barren;
Ridsdale was fortunate_ as the saying goes_ to get into many of the \"good things\" of those days_ and_ judging by the fine establishment he was speedily enabled to set up in the neighbourhood of *_ he must_ almost at the outset of his turf career_ have discovered a way of \"making\" large sums of money.,York,saw,blacklegs,up-keep
Among * patrons was the Honourable Edward Petre_ who for some years_ \"in the days when George the Fourth was king_\" enjoyed the favours of fortune on the racecourse_ having won the St. Leger on four different occasions_ three of his wins being in consecutive years.,his,3725,Majesty,ran

As a *_ Gully was a man of indomitable courage_ as plucky in the roped arena as his partner Ridsdale was in the hunting-field.,boxer,imaginative,wealthiest,success)
It was while carrying on business as a publican that Gully saw his way to fortune in the betting ring; like some other shrewd persons_ he early discovered that \"backing\" horses was an unprofitable avocation_ * come to the conclusion that the chief gains of the turf remained in the hands of the men who laid the odds.,having,you!),McGrath,£500;
\"Backers_\" as they are called_ go down before the bookmakers like so many ninepins_ whilst the layers of the odds to all comers continue * stand up and grow rich.,to,Gregory,computers,bookmaking
Impressed with that view of the situation_ Gully speedily became a professional betting *_ or \"leg_\" as such persons were then termed_ and_ by paying intelligent attention to business_ met with prompt and extraordinary success.,man,sharing,contemporary,life-like
He commenced at a fortunate time—just_ indeed_ as betting was beginning to be recognised as a business_ and when men were awakening more and more to the fact that it * better for them to deal with a professional layer of the odds all round than to make bets with each other.,was,command,maltreated,commencing

Gentlemen who had taken notice of his native shrewdness and capacity for figures entrusted him with commissions to back their horses_ so that_ in a manner_ fortune was thrust upon him_ the many secrets he became possessed of in this line of business enabling him to * in a powerful light_ whilst his less fortunate brethren of the ring had to carry on their betting work pretty much in the dark.,work,Archbishop,it\",employer
The commissions with * he was so frequently entrusted showed Gully what were the expectations of owners_ and not only which horses might win_ but also some as well which were sure to be beaten; because on the turf there was then_ as there is now_ two kinds of \"commissions\"—one to back a given horse_ or it might be two or three horses_ for the same event_ the other to lay against animals meant to lose.,which,couched,Cock-fighting,Jerry
With \"such dispositions of things\" in his favour_ he is a poor hand at the business who cannot_ when the struggle is over_ show a * balance.,winning,believe,racecourse,\"steal\"
The days of Gully were those of heavy betting_ so far as individual speculation was concerned; that is to say_ there * then be a hundred men on the turf who betted to stakes of hundreds or thousands; but at the present time_ although individual bets are not perhaps made to such large amounts_ the number of persons who bet is as hundreds to one to what the number was when John Gully was a prominent person in the ring.,might,Bluegown's,continued,enthusiastic
At the \"period\" referred to_ say from about 1818 to 1840_ race-horses were less numerous than they are at present_ * bookmakers_ moreover_ were not so plentiful as now; but most of them managed to do a good business and to put money in their purses.,and,season\",Trumper's,demanded\"
Gully_ gathering experience day by day_ was soon able to play a prominent part in the heavy speculations which formed a feature of the turf in those times; and whenever he thought any commission entrusted to him was a really good one—that is to *_ as denoting the chance of the horse to win—he followed the lead of his employer_ and by doing so often won considerable sums; whilst if he knew_ as he frequently did_ that a horse was sure to be beaten_ he would spiritedly lay the odds against its chance of winning.,say,£400000,paddock,\"looking
It is recorded that on one occasion he was engaged to back two horses in a race to win_ and_ along with a confederate_ he had five to lay against; the two which he backed to win ran first and second_ the others_ as had been \"arranged_\" came in a long way * the winner.,behind,sharks,dishonest,captain
A few chances of that kind soon bring grist to * betting man's mill.,a,£1400,then\",phrases
By the year 1827 Gully's business had * flourished that he was able to purchase for £4_200 (then a large sum to pay for a horse) the winner of that year's Blue Ribbon of the turf—Mameluke_ the property of Lord Jersey.,so,illustrious,To,money\"—in
The horse was bought with a view to winning the St. Leger_ and the transactions made by Gully on behalf of his purchase afford a glimpse of the * figures of that period.,betting,King—\"the,allowance,perplexed
As soon as the bargain had been effected between Lord Jersey and himself_ Gully requested that it should not be made * till he had obtained a good opportunity of backing the horse for the great race of September (the St. Leger)_ which he was enabled to do at Ascot.,known,aware,\"cannot,deaths
At that famous race meeting he accepted the odds of 10 * 1 against his horse to the tune of £1_000_ thus standing to win £10_000 if his horse should prove victorious at Doncaster.,to,piece,damaged,relate
Not contented_ however_ with that considerable speculation_ Mr. Gully made several other bets_ as_ for instance_ one that Mameluke would beat ten horses (in the St. Leger)_ which horses he at once named; likewise that his colt would beat a lot of nine horses * the same race—these he also_ of course_ named.,in,28th,\"men,\"speculators\"
All three bets were made for the same amounts_ namely_ £10_000 to £1_000_ and in the end they had to be paid by Mr. Gully_ as_ unfortunately for him_ the name of Matilda_ the horse which * the St. Leger of 1827_ was written in both lists_ so that after the St. Leger had been run he found he had a sum of £3_000 to pay_ every penny of which was duly handed over—two-thirds of it to Crockford—on the day of reckoning.,won,windows,hatfuls,safely
The struggle for that year's St. Leger was no * over than it was alleged there had been foul play in connection with the race_ and there is great probability that the allegation was not unfounded_ and that Mameluke was \"prevented\" from winning the race—a species of \"turf tactics\" not unknown even at present_ and occasionally resorted to when other modes of \"getting at\" a horse_ or his trainer_ or jockey_ do not prove successful.,sooner,Saltem,£2000,identification
The chicanery of the turf is varied in its action: when the animal itself can be \"doctored_\" that of course makes certain the \"nobbled\" horse will lose; a pail of water—\"just a real hearty drink\" * a well-known northern trainer used to say)—given to the animal a little time before the race falls to be run_ generally_ but not always_ ensures defeat.,(as,dimensions,substantial,120
Other means of \"doctoring\" a racehorse are sometimes resorted to_ it being always a safer plan to make the horse \"right\" than to depend upon a jockey to \"pull it_\" as riders whose evil intention has been suspected have been changed at the last moment_ * the horse_ being entrusted to the guidance of an honest jockey_ may win instead of losing the race.,and,asking,dining,Leeds
In the case of Matilda_ it has been stated that the starter was the guilty party—that_ in fact_ he had been bribed to give his signal to \"go\" when it would be least advantageous to Mr. Gully's horse_ which_ being a restless_ irritable animal_ contributed much to the tactics of the opposition * its fractiousness at the starting-post.,by,geldings,accepted,Salisbury

The two ultimately became partners_ or \"confederates_\" in a good many of the turf events of their day; but it is quite clear they were not acting in concert at Doncaster on the occasion of the St. Leger of 1827.

As a matter of course_ St. Giles had been used simply as an instrument of gambling; as * two-year-old_ his quality as a race-horse had been hidden by his having undoubtedly been \"pulled\" in his earlier races_ so that when the day of his victory arrived_ the odds against his chance might be large enough to make it worth the while of his owner to let him run.,a,Race-horses\":,responsible,leisurely

As all versed in our racing records already know_ the race for the Oaks in the year 1844 was won by Princess_ an animal which had been very heavily backed by William Crockford_ both on his own account and for the benefit of a band of followers who \"stood in\" with him; but as on the previous night the mighty gambler was seized with an attack of paralysis which resulted in his sudden demise_ there was consternation among * clique.,the,proves,engaged,Horsemanship

Another branch of turf business which Crockford conducted at one time was that of \"squaring\" * books of smaller betting men than himself; he could always be relied upon_ even at the last moment—that is_ immediately before a race—to lay the odds against such horses as a bookmaker was \"bad\" against_ and required therefore to back back again_ so as not to run greater risk than was compatible with an honest desire to meet engagements_ and pay what was seen to be due after the race was determined.,the,dealer,\"How,reluctant

Sir Richard Strongman_ Lord Strapmore_ and * Honourable Thomas Rowbotham have each entered three or four of their horses in an important handicap_ what is more natural_ on the turf_ than that they should lay their heads together to \"best\" the public_ and pull off a good thing at long odds for themselves?

What was generally resolved upon to begin with was_ that each of those present should_ a month before the race_ find out by means of a formal trial his best horse for the handicap at the published weights; next_ that in a couple of days thereafter the three should * tried together along with the best public horse they were able to buy or borrow to take part in the trial at a weight agreed upon.,be,confederacy,outcome,difficult;

In the end its success is ensured_ Pretty Jane beating Artful Dodger_ a rod in pickle prepared by a quiet * of turfites for the same race_ by only a head; \"too near a thing to be pleasant_\" as Lord Strapmore said after the struggle was over_ and the confederacy had obtained breathing time for a glass of champagne and mutual congratulations.,school,fellow-lodger,history;,brilliant

\"Working the oracle_\" with intent to make a grand _ is work which requires to be gone about with judgment; but in a race where twenty or more stables are represented it is * to ensure success_ there being always somebody interested who  be obstinate_ or who demands too large a share of the spoil_ or insists upon some impossible condition.,difficult,cease,Yorkshiremen,pending
When the Mr. Smooth of such an enterprise has made some progress in his negotiations_ he often enough finds himself face to face with the representative of another clique engaged in the same business; it is not_ indeed_ the first time that three distinct syndicates * come into collision_ each fancying itself to hold the winning card.,have,\"bottled,brilliant;,respectable

At other times a lot of horses do not accept because \"something\" has been \"thrown in\" at a feather weight which everybody thinks cannot possibly be beaten_ although in the end that something runs nearly last_ Ruperra to wit_ in the Royal Hunt Cup of 1880.

When they find_ after a trial with some horse of their own or one borrowed from a friend_ that they have no chance of winning the race for which the horse has been entered_ they at once strike it out of that race—\"scratch it\" * the usual phrase employed—so that the public may not be induced to back it.,is,1756,competitions,first-class
On the other hand_ there are owners * never scratch their horses unless they find their intention of backing them anticipated by the public.,who,regards,bitters,duty;

It has become a debatable * in the ethics of horse-racing whether the owner of a horse_ having once entered it in a public race_ should withdraw it from participation in that race from not being able to back it on his own terms_ because of Tom_ Dick_ and Harry having been more active than he has been in dealing with the bookmakers_ and so forestalling him in the market.,point,adjudication,settles,entrance

In reality it is the general public who provide the money which the bookmakers lay to owners of horses; as some owners never bet_ whilst others bet only to small sums_ it * evident_ therefore_ that without the aid of the crowns_ half-sovereigns_ and pounds of the small bettors it would be impossible for the bookmakers to deal in those large sums which gentlemen occasionally back their horses to win.,is,miss,hurt,31st

Another phase of the chicanery of the turf may be now alluded to_ arising from the mercenary spirit of certain greedy owners—it is the practice of an owner to take a big bet about one of his horses_ and * his \"lot\" in the hands of a bookmaker to \"work\" in the market as he pleases.,leave,(1829),beg,prodigious
The right of a man to wallop his own nigger has been asserted; in the same spirit there are men who_ having accepted in a handicap or other race with four or five horses_ claim to do with them as * please_ and what this style of doing business leads to can be gathered from the preceding pages.,they,high-mettled,overlooked,Prebend

In plain language_ the owner so acting simply lends himself to a fraud_ because the bookmaker_ knowing that only the horse which he has laid against is intended to win_ takes his measures accordingly_ and manages so to bring the others before the public that they will all in turn be well backed by unthinking backers—the horse which is intended to win the race being kept_ when possible_ carefully in the background_ stories about its condition being published which prevent * being noticed.,its,functions,5465,\"retain\"

Mr. Salisbury Moor_ having been informed by his trainer that his horse_ Fatcheeks_ had won a very excellent trial for an important handicap_ resolved in consequence_ in conjunction with Bill Gaiters_ his trainer_ to back his animal to win the odds to £300; the odds against the horse (there being three in the same stable_ each thought to have a better chance than Fatcheeks) being at the time nominally 66 to 1.

\" Lady Elizabeth_ during her two-year-old career_ had never but once known defeat_ as can be seen by referring to the turf chronicles of 1867_ in which year the value of the stakes won by her reached a total of £9_665. The race which her ladyship failed to * during her two-year-old career was an important one_ namely_ the Middle Park Plate_ which race fell to fortunate Sir Joseph by the aid of his horse_ Greensleeve; Rosicrucian_ an animal belonging to the same owner_ running second.,win,punishment,productive,desirable
No sooner had the struggle for the Blue Ribbon of 1868 been decided—in which Lady Elizabeth was nearer last than first_ although she started the undoubted favourite for the event with odds of 7 to 4 betted against her chance—than persons began to shake their heads * give utterance to the usual stereotyped remarks germane to such occasions_ as_ \"I told you so_\" \"A rank stiff one_\" \"What a scandal_\" and so forth.,and,921,Black,nationality
In plain language_ it was assumed by a large section of the public that Lady Elizabeth had never been intended to win the *_ but that_ on the contrary_ the mare had been for months an abject \"market horse_\" and that thousands of pounds had been invested on the animal for the benefit of the Marquis and his aiders and abettors in the fraud; that all connected with Lady Elizabeth_ from her owner down to the boy who every morning removed the litter from her stall_ had made fortunes by means of the milking pail which had been in such constant requisition! Moreover it was currently stated among numerous reports circulated that Admiral Rous had asserted that the mare_ just previous to the race_ had been heavily drugged with laudanum; but the Admiral_ in a letter to  newspaper under the date of June 15th_ 1868_ gave an emphatic contradiction to that report.,Derby,fortunes;,flock,four-mile
In continuation_ the Admiral went on to say: \"My belief is that Lady Elizabeth had a rough spin with Athena in March_ when the Days discovered she had lost her form—a very common occurrence with fillies severely trained at two years old; that when the discovery was made they reversed a commission to back her for the One Thousand Guineas at Newmarket; and they declared that Lord Hastings would * bring her out before the Derby_ on which he stood to win a great stake.,not,Pelisse,sensation?,bankers

But when we come to the facts of the case we find that nothing was ever put forward to show that the mare was either improperly treated or neglected in any way_ and I think that we have a right to assume that there was no ground for the complaints_ but rather that credit should be given to those in charge of her for assiduity in everything that skill or experience could suggest * her well-being_ and that the whole mystery may be summed up in these few words: no robbery took place_ nor was one ever contemplated; the mare had simply lost her form—she was not so good as a three as she was as a two-year-old.,for,(then,drawn,buy

Strictly speaking_ the Jockey Club had no authority or power to extend or enforce * observance of their laws at any other meetings than those held at Newmarket; but it soon became evident that a uniform and general application of its rules or laws was desirable_ and therefore by a sort of tacit understanding it gradually became customary for all race meetings of importance to place themselves under the laws of the Jockey Club by a general consent and acknowledgment of its authority.,the,over-weight,East\",moment
In many cases_ however_ there was a doubt respecting the extent and power of application * the said laws_ and therefore_ in 1831_ the Jockey Club notified that their rules and orders applied to Newmarket _ but they recommended their adoption to the stewards of other races_ and in places where they were publicly adopted and recognised the Jockey Club would investigate and decide on disputes submitted to them for adjudication_ but not otherwise.,of,application,wherever,ends

Why should it be possible to make an informal entry of any horse for any race?
