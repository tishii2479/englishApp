It seems to suggest that no great distinction is made between children and *_ and really there is not as much difference as we find at home.,grown-ups,Christians,naturally,thirty-eight
The children are taught to take life very seriously and are treated as * men and women before their time_ and so they have no time to grow up into proper men and women_ and the result is that we find the children too grown-up and the grown-ups too childish.,little,European,arrived,Missionary

Now Muhammad_ the false prophet whom the Persians believe in and obey_ had no such high standard to set before them_ no such high ideal for them to grow * to_ as our Lord Jesus Christ set before His followers and enables them to grow up to and so his religion provides only a short time for growing up_ and stunts instead of assisting the growth both of individual Muhammadans and of Muhammadan nations.,up,handful,least,fracture
