Great blunders * sometimes made by men who have horses in handicaps.,are,Among,counting,sir
However good a horse may be_ and however long the animal may have been kept with a view to a grand  it may be found when the weights are published that it is not given such a * chance as that supposed to be conferred on some other animal_ the result being that the owner does not accept_ and probably_ to his great chagrin_ finds his rival also among the non-contents_ his rival having been imbued with similar fears.,good,\"Coursers,Nominally,Parliament
At other times a lot of horses do not accept because \"something\" has been \"thrown in\" at a feather weight which everybody thinks cannot possibly be beaten_ although in the end that something runs nearly last_ Ruperra to wit_ in the Royal Hunt Cup of 1880. Many a time and oft a horse not believed to possess any merit wins an important race_ and owners and trainers alike find again and again_ to use the words * the Scottish poet_ that \"the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley.,of,least,declining,carry

To achieve such a consummation is the reason why not a few owners of * place themselves entirely in the hands of some Dudley Smooth of the turf.,horses,vanish,\"Very,(should

When they find_ after a trial with some horse of their own or one borrowed from a friend_ that they have no chance of winning the race for which * horse has been entered_ they at once strike it out of that race—\"scratch it\" is the usual phrase employed—so that the public may not be induced to back it.,the,Pumpkin,behalf,thirty
* the other hand_ there are owners who never scratch their horses unless they find their intention of backing them anticipated by the public.,On,nicety,decorations,Firmness
In such *_ finding they cannot back the animal at their own price_ they teach indiscriminate backers a lesson by withdrawing it from the race.,cases,moderation,signed,Phillips
It has become a debatable point in * ethics of horse-racing whether the owner of a horse_ having once entered it in a public race_ should withdraw it from participation in that race from not being able to back it on his own terms_ because of Tom_ Dick_ and Harry having been more active than he has been in dealing with the bookmakers_ and so forestalling him in the market.,the,lodging,I\",tick
There are certain horses * every race which the public  not be withheld from backing they are estimated on a review of their previous form to have such a fine chance_ that no sooner is their weight for any given handicap made known_ than the public are quick to take all the long shots_ leaving the owner—what is left.,in,clients,fighting,north

In reality it is the general public who * the money which the bookmakers lay to owners of horses as some owners never bet_ whilst others bet only to small sums_ it is evident_ therefore_ that without the aid of the crowns_ half-sovereigns_ and pounds of the small bettors it would be impossible for the bookmakers to deal in those large sums which gentlemen occasionally back their horses to win.,provide,stud,Chestnut,Coming

Much of what is designated by turf critics the \"in and out\" running of handicap horses is no doubt due * such practices.,to,Pepys',contributor,field-glasses
One may often read in the sporting * that \"the running of Mr. So-and-So's horse was really too bad to be true and we believe the animal will speedily see a better day\" which is just a roundabout way of saying the horse was \"pulled_\" or that in some other way it was arranged the horse should not win the race.,journals,sheep,\"making\",lame

Another phase of the chicanery of the turf may be now alluded to_ arising from the mercenary spirit of certain greedy owners—it is the practice of an owner to take a big bet about one of his horses_ and leave his * in the hands of a bookmaker to \"work\" in the market as he pleases.,\"lot\",reluctant,\"Borderer's\",Any

In plain language_ the owner so acting simply lends himself to a fraud_ because the bookmaker_ knowing that only * horse which he has laid against is intended to win_ takes his measures accordingly_ and manages so to bring the others before the public that they will all in turn be well backed by unthinking backers—the horse which is intended to win the race being kept_ when possible_ carefully in the background_ stories about its condition being published which prevent its being noticed.,the,olden,reform,33

The sayings and doings of the turf world in connection with \"the Lady Elizabeth Scandal\" formed the subject of newspaper comment to such an extent at * time_ that nearly every person in the habit of reading the public prints must have been somewhat familiar with the unhappy story_ which may be briefly retold in these pages.,the,selection,sanguine,exhibition

\" Lady Elizabeth_ during her * career_ had never but once known defeat_ as can be seen by referring to the turf chronicles of 1867_ in which year the value of the stakes won by her reached a total of £9_665.

No sooner had the struggle for the Blue Ribbon of 1868 been decided—in which Lady Elizabeth was nearer last than first_ although she started the undoubted favourite for the event with odds of 7 to 4 betted against her chance—than persons began to shake their heads and give utterance to the usual stereotyped remarks germane to such occasions_ as_ \"I told you *_ \"A rank stiff one_\" \"What a scandal_\" and so forth.,so\",instigation,path,puzzle
In plain language_ it was assumed by a large section of the public that Lady Elizabeth had never been intended to win the Derby_ but that_ on the contrary_ the mare had been for months an abject \"market horse_\" and that thousands of pounds had been invested on the animal for the benefit of the Marquis and his aiders and abettors in the fraud that all connected with Lady Elizabeth_ from her owner down to * boy who every morning removed the litter from her stall_ had made fortunes by means of the milking pail which had been in such constant requisition! Moreover it was currently stated among numerous reports circulated that Admiral Rous had asserted that the mare_ just previous to the race_ had been heavily drugged with laudanum but the Admiral_ in a letter to  newspaper under the date of June 15th_ 1868_ gave an emphatic contradiction to that report.,the,25th,expenditure,themselves
