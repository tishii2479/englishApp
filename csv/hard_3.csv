A remarkable set of rules for the guidance of those taking part in the competition * the original Town Plate was devised in this reign_ and_ as will be evident from the following extracts_ afforded a foundation for many of the rules of racing_ which afterwards came in use all over England.,for,judge!,generally,Cup—in
One of the rules is worded as follows \"Every horse that rideth shall be bridled_ saddled_ and shod_ and his rider shall weigh twelve stone_ fourteen pounds to the stone_ and every rider that wanteth above one pound and a half * he hath rid the heat_ shall win no plate or prize.,after,1600,\"Won,Considerable
\" Another rule says \"Whosoever doth stop or stay any of the horses that rideth for this plate or prize_ if he be either *_ servant_ party_ or bettor_ and it appears to be willingly done_ he shall win no plate_ prize_ or bets.,owner,meritorious,ditch,winning
\" Moreover_ \"Every rider that layeth hold on_ or striketh any of the riders_ * win no plate or prize.,shall,Macaroni,\"X.,relative
\" Another rule confers on the judges the following power \"Any of the judges may call any of the riders at the end of any of the heats_ and if he be found to have fraudulently cast away any of his weight and want any more than his pound and a half_ he shall * the plate_ prize_ and stakes.,lose,fifty-three,bell-hanging,revolution
\" One more extract from these * will suffice \"Whosoever winneth the plate or prize shall give to the clerk of the course twenty shillings to be distributed to the poor on both sides of Newmarket_ and twenty shillings to the clerk of the race_ for which he is to keep the horse plain and free from holes and cart roots.,rules,infantile,breath,Mount
Betting and \"turf profligacy\" of * kinds were in these times indulged in at Newmarket to an extent far beyond the bounds of morality and prudence_ and_ although King and Court were_ so to put it_ in \"the swim\" of all that occurred_ an Act of Parliament required to be passed to restrain gaming and betting on race-horses to an excessive amount \"on tick or credit.,all,thumbs,\"Keep,Newland's
\" It was upon the Act which was then passed that the celebrated  actions_ brought in 1843-44 against * noblemen and gentlemen to recover penalties for betting_ were chiefly or at any rate partly based.,certain,slight,board,lessened
It may be as well * state here the scope of the Act_ which was entitled_ \"An Act against deceitful_ disorderly_ and excessive gaming.,to,soe,happy,bigness
The preamble of this piece of legislation was decidedly couched in severe language it asserted that all games and exercises_ when not used in an innocent and moderate manner_ encourage idleness and tend to a dissolute * of life_ and to the debauching of the nobility and gentry and others to the loss of their precious time_ and the utter ruin of their estates and fortunes.,course,mentioning,announced,shifted
Following * exordium_ it was duly enacted that no person_ by the exercise of deceit_ could obtain any sum or sums of money or other valuable lost to them at any of the games of the period_ which_ as set forth_ were Cards_ Dice_ Tables_ Tennis_ Bowles_ Kittles_ Shovel-board_ Cock-fighting_ Horse-racing_ Dog matches_ and Foot races but_ on the other hand_ would be required to forfeit and lose treble the sum or value of money_ one moiety thereof to be given to the King_ the other half being destined for the person aggrieved.,this,incredulous,\"making,Railways
It was also at the same time enacted for the better * and preventing of all excessive and immoderate playing and gaming for the time to come_ that no person could recover any sum betted on credit which was above the value of one hundred pounds_ and that persons betting on tick or credit above that sum shall forfeit and lose treble the value of all such sum or sums of money or valuables which they shall so win.,avoiding,\"Thou'lt,staying,States
