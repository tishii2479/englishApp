The principal officials required for the conduct of a race meeting are a clerk of the course_ a handicapper_ a starter_ and a *.,judge,Scientific,add,1785

The handicapper is an * functionary.,important,pickle,drank,petty
Clerks of * course often officiate in the capacity of handicappers_ or adjusters of the weights sometimes_ too_ the office of handicapper and judge are combined indeed_ at some race meetings_ the whole three offices are occasionally conjoined in one person in theatrical parlance_ the clerk of the course very often \"doubles\" the office of judge and handicapper.,the,\"About,admitted,Fergus
During a race meeting lasting over three or four days_ the handicapper finds plenty of work_ as_ in addition to having apportioned weights to all the horses engaged in the larger handicaps_ nurseries_ and sweepstakes_ many days_ in some cases months_ before the date of the meeting_ he has to adjust the weights for those races which are run * day to day_ for which horses are not entered till the evening before the day on which they are to run.,from,supposed,funds,\"yearlings\"
A handicapper must be resourceful and ever on the alert_ ready on every opportunity to display_ in practical fashion_ his * knowledge of the qualities and previous achievements of horses_ so as to be able to place the various animals on an equality in an overnight handicap.,abounding,breed,readable,No
Race meetings are largely dependent on \"the go\" and ability of the person engaged as handicapper_ because owners and trainers are a rather jealous class_ and quite able * detect at once_ and resent_ by withdrawal of their horses for the race_ and their non-entry in future contests_ any flagrant instance of favouritism.,to,profitable,needless,obvious

No meeting is perfect * the assistance of the \"starter_\" an official whose business it is to start the competing horses.,without,extremely,brighter,impeached
The duty of the starter_ more particularly when there is a large field of young horses (two-year-olds)_ is difficult to perform satisfactorily_ especially when the short distance to be run (say five furlongs) is taken into account * is of the utmost importance_ therefore_ that each horse shall start on equal terms.,it,fewer,overnight,horse-loving
A starter must possess firmness and decision of character in no ordinary measure_ as he may have at times as many * forty jockeys under command_ several of the boys being mounted on very unruly animals_ while others may be wilfully goading their horses into unruliness on purpose to delay the start_ thereby so fatiguing the younger riders as to make them lose command of their horses_ and thus lose their chance of winning.,as,handicaps,moment,compare
Starters have necessarily much in * power and instances are known of such officials having occasionally favoured a particular horse_ by allowing it to obtain what is called_ in racing parlance_ a \"flying start_\" or some other advantage.,their,Gripely,economists,judges
