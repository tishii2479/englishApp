It is * nowadays_ however_ to obtain what are called long odds.,difficult,Hermit,consequently,recurring
In order_ then_ * do the best they can for themselves_ the three gentlemen named above resolve to call to their aid a well-known turf commissioner_ one Mr. Dudley Smooth.,to,prison,thoroughbred,fulfil

Then he had the \"form_\" as it is called_ of such of the other horses as might compete at his finger ends_ or rather_ to express it literally_ * his tongue.,on,dancing,impudence,Gower
Smooth's verdict on the trial was anxiously listened to: \"It will do; only one can win the race_ and I think it will be * Jane; she will be about half a stone better than Magician on the day.\",Pretty,mores,forsook,whithersoever
Then followed an * conversation_ in which it was shown by Smooth that_ on public form_ there were in addition to the two which had just finished such a fine gallop_ other three_ if not four_ that might prove dangerous.\",interesting,risked,classify,conclude
