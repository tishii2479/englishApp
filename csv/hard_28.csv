In an excellent_ although brief_ sketch of the history of the Club contributed to the \"Badminton Library_\" we are told that tradition points to its origin in the year 1750_ before which time the usual meeting-place for gentlemen attending * was the \"Red Lion Inn_\" the site of which is supposed to have been on the present Station Road.,Newmarket,sly,Yearlings?,necessity

Strictly speaking_ the Jockey Club had no authority or power to extend or enforce the observance of their laws at any other meetings than those held at Newmarket but it soon became evident that a uniform and general application of its rules or laws * desirable_ and therefore by a sort of tacit understanding it gradually became customary for all race meetings of importance to place themselves under the laws of the Jockey Club by a general consent and acknowledgment of its authority.,was,because,Derby\",turf
In many cases_ however_ there was a doubt respecting the extent and power of application of the said laws_ and therefore_ in 1831_ the Jockey Club notified that their rules and orders applied to Newmarket _ but they recommended their adoption to the stewards of other races_ and in places where they were publicly adopted and recognised the Jockey Club would investigate and decide on disputes submitted to them for adjudication_ but * otherwise.,not,severity,deceive,run

I am indebted for these remarks which_ so far_ indicate the rise of the Jockey Club to power_ to an anonymous volume published in 1863_ which contains many observations on the powers and duties of the Club_ and the mode in which they ought to be carried into execution_ the object of the commentator being to point out how wonderful a circumstance it is that * whole racing community can be held in check by a self-constituted body.,the,blood—a,till,24th
