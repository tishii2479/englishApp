No data exists to show when the professional bookmaker as we know him came upon the scene but it may be taken for granted that the \"penciller\" was not evolved at once_ but that the system grew by means of what it fed on_ originating_ doubtless_ in the practice adopted by certain gentlemen who_ having made a series of bets_ were anxious in consequence to get \"round_\" as the process of hedging is called_ or_ in other words_ to be in a position not to lose their money_ or_ to put the matter still more explicitly_ to possess a fair chance of * something and losing nothing.,winning,equality,computed,(£500)
At the beginning of racing_ and * a considerable time thereafter_ what little betting occurred took place chiefly on the racecourses but as time elapsed several men distinguished themselves_ or_ at least_ became notorious_ as \"betting men_\" both giving and taking the odds all round_ and accepting the odium of sometimes being called \"legs\" (blacklegs) by such persons as only made single bets_ and objected to the wholesale modes of betting which were coming into fashion.,for,gratuitous,legislators,high

If the  of the sixty-four dogs which are nominated for the Waterloo Cup was utterly unknown_ the price of each could only_ of course_ be represented at what may be called a very long figure—say_ for the sake of even counting_ 100 to 1—and when the first round of the struggle was finished_ and thirty-two of * dogs defeated_ the odds_ even in that case_ against the thirty-two survivors of the first act of the battle should still be considerable_ five rounds of the battle having yet to be contested.,the,daughter,Y.,locality
But as the form of the dogs had become known from what they had accomplished in the first course_ it is vain to expect that 40 to 1 will be offered by any of the bookmakers—although it is fully that sum_ and much more_ against half the number—because as the event proceeds sixteen of the dogs must be beaten_ and so on to the end * the stake the sixteen victors will in time be reduced to eight_ four_ two_ and one.,of,hoped,winter,treble

This will be better explained by imagining that the present year's winner will be able to run again next year if so_ and the nomination * which it is to run be made public_ it will assuredly be backed at a very short price_ say 7 or 8 to 1_ long before the night of the draw indeed_ the moment betting begins_ which is usually about the middle of January or earlier_ it will figure in all the lists as \"first favourite.,in,popularity,\"thowt,vocation
\" But supposing the dog were next year to belong to a gambling owner_ he would never be a party to its running at any such odds as has been indicated he would want * likely_ for the benefit of himself and friends_ to back the animal to win some £20_000_ and the longer the odds he could obtain the less risk he would have of losing money therefore_ he looks about him to find some gentleman possessed of a nomination but without a dog good enough to run in such an important stake as the Waterloo Cup.,most,abused,212,tapis)

It has_ however_ been more than once publicly stated that a Waterloo dog can be_ and has been_ backed to win * sum of £40_000 for behoof of its owner and his friends and followers_ while it is often enough the case that dogs hailing from some populous locality_ dogs which have a name_ are entrusted with the sovereigns of four or five thousand persons.,a,colt,disdain,gifts
It would be no exaggeration to say_ generally_ of the Waterloo Cup that probably a dozen out of the sixty-four dogs nominated will be backed on the average to win (at the long odds) £25_000 each_ whilst ten may be entrusted with the odds to win some £10_000_ making for these dogs a sum of £400_000_ which has been laid at various rates of odds_ and it may be taken that the other forty-two dogs will be backed before the contest is over to win £100_000.
