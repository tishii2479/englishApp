Most of the damage done by birds and complained of by farmers and fruit growers arises from this very cause_ the berry-producing shrubs and seed-bearing weeds * been cleared away_ and the birds have no recourse but to attack the cultivated grain or fruit which has replaced their natural food supply.,have,acorns,melons,woodboring
The * majority of land birds subsist upon insects during the period of nesting and molting_ and also feed their young upon them during the first few weeks.,great,gnats,notable,too
