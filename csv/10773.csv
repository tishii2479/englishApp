In these paragraphs is said all that need be said of one of our most devoted * understanding Theosophists.,and,absolutely,attach,grain
In March_ 1901_ The Theosophical Forum lost one of its most willing and * contributors.,unfailing,another—in,times,subject
Mr. T.E. Willson died suddenly_ and the news of his death reached me when I actually * in the act of preparing the concluding chapter of his \"Ancient and Modern Physics\" for the April number.,was,relation,abstract,centre
For twenty years and more I was without a hearing_ * my interest and my faith in what I had to say never flagged_ the eagerness of my love for my subject never diminished.,yet,respond,others,astrologer
The quiet and sustained resistance to indifference and lack of appreciation_ is truly the steady * which has prevented our Theosophical ship from aimless and fatal wanderings_ though of inclement weather and adverse winds we had plenty.,ballast,bulk,priest,acquiring
For many long years Mr. Willson was the librarian of the New York \"World.\"  In the afternoons he was too busy to see outsiders_ but_ beginning with * o'clock in the afternoon until he went home somewhere in the neighbourhood of midnight_ he always was glad to see his friends.,five,entity,varying,without
He had a tiny little room * his own_ very near the top of the tremendous building_ his one window looking far above the roofs of the tallest houses in the district.,of,afternoons,sharing,credit
There he sat at his desk_ generally in his shirt sleeves_ if the weather was at all warm_ always busy with some matter already printed_ or going to be_ a *_ yet impressive and dignified figure.,quiet,collected,disclaimers,through
They shared the loftiness of their point of view_ their sympathetic understanding of other folks_ their loneliness_ *_ above all_ their patient_ even humorous resignation to the fact of this loneliness.,and,material,better,sized
Yet in his appearance Mr. Willson * not like the great Weissnichtwo philosopher.,was,softer,digit,links
In fact_ in the cast of his features and in his ways_ Mr. Willson never looked * me like a white man.,to,connected,until,apparent
In British India I have known Brahmans of * better type exactly with the same sallow complexion_ same quick and observant brown eye_ same portly figure and same wide-awakeness and agility of manner.,the,represents,brings,dog
Last summer I heard_ on good authority_ that Mr. Willson had thought himself into a most suggestive way of dealing with * problems of matter and spirit_ a way which_ besides being suggestive_ bore a great resemblance to some theories of the same nature_ current in ancient India.,the,forces—light,assistance,a
Consequently Mr. Willson was offered_ for the first time in his life_ a chance of expressing his views on matter and spirit in as many articles and in as * a shape as he chose.,extensive,require,liquids,broadly
The way he received this tardy recognition of the * that he had something to say was highly instructive.,fact,accept,hours,holds
He did not put on airs of unrecognized greatness_ though_ I own_ the occasion was propitious;  he did not say_ \"I told you so;\"  he simply and frankly was *_ in_ the most childlike way.,glad,been,sending,consists
And now that I have used the word_ it occurs to me that \"childlike\" is an adjective the best applied to this man_ in spite of his *_ and his three score and more winters.,portliness,reuse,short,way
Many a pleasant * I have spent in the small bookroom of the great \"World\" building.,hour,treated,lines,translation
With Mr. Willson * never flagged.,talk,faint,corresponding,much
Mr. Willson's gratitude to the Theosophical Forum for its * was disproportionately great.,recognition,firmament,mysteries,been
At the news of his death * a heart was sincerely sad_ but none so sad as the heart of the editor of the Theosophical Forum.,many,exceeds,express,increases
For a friend * co-worker like T.E. Willson_ ever ready to give material help and moral encouragement_ is not easily replaced.,and,unison,octaves,trademark
For a soul so * of any kind of selfishness the transition from the turmoil of life to the bright dreams of death must have been both easy and enviable.,pure,effort,attention,sight
The Hindu system of physics_ on which the metaphysical thought of the East is based_ does not in * beginnings differ widely from the latest physics of the West;  but it goes so much farther that our physics is soon lost sight of and forgotten.,its,sum,phrases,cared
The Hindu conception of the material universe_ taken from the Upanishads and some open teaching_ will serve * an illustration.,for,problems,kinds—prakriti,worship
They divide physical matter into four kinds—prakriti_ ether_ prana_ and manasa—which they call \"planes.\"  These differ only in the rate of vibration_ each plane vibrating * one great octave_ with gulfs of \"lost\" octaves between.,through,zero,twentyfourhour,bodies
The highest rate of vibration of prakriti is measured by the thousand_ the * of the ether by trillions_ and the lowest of prana by—never mind; they have_ and we have not_ the nomenclature.,lowest,humorous,experience,harmony
The earth_ they teach_ is a globe of prakriti_ floating in an * of ether_ which_ as it has the sun for its center of gravity_ must necessarily be a globe.,ocean,elephant,theorists,realities

All the planets revolve around the sun far within * atmosphere.,its,chilled,vibrated,awakened
The etheric sun-globe revolves on its axis * in about 21_000 years_ and this revolution causes the precession of the equinoxes.,once,eagerness,medium,conception

Its orbit * a diameter of 93_000_000_000_000_000 miles.,has,coadunition—four,measured,distribution
Beyond * etheric globes_ and between them_ is a third form of matter called prana_ as much rarer and finer than the ether as the ether is rarer and finer than prakriti.,the,transcend,small,sunglobe
As this * has Alcyone for a center of gravity_ it is necessarily a globe;  and there are many of these pranic globes floating in a vast ocean of manasa—a form of matter as much finer than prana as prana is finer than ether_ or ether than prakriti.,prana,unraveled,square,tale
The material universe is created from manasa_ downward_ but it does not respond to or chord with the vibration of the globes above_ except in a * instance and in a special way_ which does not touch this inquiry.,special,stellar,ensuring,numerous
Professor Lodge in 1884 put forth * theory that prakriti (physical matter) as we call it_ was in its atoms but \"whirls\" of ether.,the,inherit,failure,translate
Since then speculative science has generally accepted the idea that the physical atom is made up of many * feet of ether in chemical union_ as many quarts of oxygen and hydrogen unite chemically to make a drop of water.,cubic,patient,us,filed

On these pranic globes the process was *_ with ether as the result_ and the etheric globes formed.,repeated,founded,constant,day

There is a comparatively narrow \"skin\" of and for phenomena within the * sun-globe_ say the Eastern teachers_ where the etheric solids_ liquids_ and gases meet and mingle and interchange.,etheric,efforts,rarer,theory
