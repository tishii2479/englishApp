In one or two instances where the clerk of the course acted also as handicapper_ as well as being lessee of the * stand_ it is said that it was his custom to \"retain\" all the big stakes in plain language_ it has been more than once implied that some handicappers were allowed_ by certain owners_ to keep the stake-money_ on condition of the horses entered by them being favoured in the apportioning of the weights.,grand,Or,latterly—that,proposals
