In a \"History of Horse-racing_\" published in 1863_ appears the following summary of the early history of the sport at Chester \"In the year 1511_ the silver bell of the value of three shillings and fourpence was first run for as a prize in 1609 or 1610_ the bell was converted into silver 'cupps_' the value of which is not stated_ and from this date the race was annually * for on the Rood Dee_ was then named and henceforth known as 'St  George's Race' and in 1623 there was another alteration made in the prize run for_ as in that year the three cups were changed into 'one faire silver cupp_' of about the value of eight pounds.,run,predecessor,buildings,wars

In these early days of the pastime of horse-racing_ there was only one day in which a race took place_ one race only being run_ and occasionally there was no lack of excitement in 1665_ for instance_ there was a \"row_\" because \"the High Sheriff borrowed a Barbary horse of Sir Thomas Middleton_ which won him the plate and_ being master of the race_ he would not suffer the horses of Master Massey of Paddington_ and of Sir Philip Egerton of Dalton_ to run_ because they came the day after the time prefixed for the horses to be brought and kept in * city which thing caused all the gentry to relinquish the races ever since.,the,condition,certainty,watched
