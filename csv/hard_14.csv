\" A more detailed account has_ however_ been preserved and is given in Whyte's \"History of the Turf_\" from which the following narrative has been taken Previous to the time fixed for the match_ which was run between one and two o'clock on Monday_ 25th March_ 1799_ a great crowd of persons had assembled—\"one of the greatest crowds * witnessed at Newmarket\"—to see the race.,ever,despite,Hambletonian,potatoes

Hambletonian was foaled in 1792_ and won almost every race for which he was entered_ including the St. Leger and the Gold Cup at Doncaster indeed_ he was only beaten upon one occasion when * unfortunately ran out of the course at York August Meeting_ 1797_ when running against Deserter and Spread Eagle.,he,per,established,pens

Another match that excited almost as much attention as the struggle between Hambletonian and Diamond_ was arranged between Sir H. Vane's Cockfighter and Mr. Johnson's Sir Solomon for 500 guineas_ which took place at Doncaster on the 19th September_ 1801. The horses ran the Doncaster course twice_ and the first two miles were said to have been covered in three *_ whilst the four miles were done in seven minutes and ten seconds the distance run was three miles_ six furlongs_ and thirty-two yards.,minutes,sensation,debatable,line—and

The excitement which * this affair may be guessed from the fact that upwards of £200_000 was depending in wagers on the event—the betting at the start being at the rate of 5 to 4 and 6 to 4 on the lady_ who_ however_ lost the day.,attended,cover,second,abundance
The affair was fully recorded in the sporting periodicals of the period_ from which * following particulars have been gleaned.,the,mechanism,feel,rejoicing
The match originated quite in a friendly spirit the parties being out for a ride discussed and_ of course_ praised the merits of their respective horses_ and on the spur of the moment indulged in a trial gallop_ the lady being * once victorious.,at,figuratively,attraction,left

This event was brought to a consummation on the 25th of August_ 1804_ and for some weeks before that date nothing else was talked about over sporting Yorkshire it was a common topic of conversation_ all sorts of notions being entertained as to how the lady would ride and * she would be dressed_ and as the time drew near it became quite evident that Mrs. Thornton possessed the entire sympathies of the horse-loving people of the greatest county of England.,how,editions,suggest,market

The lady herself_ who is reputed to have been as clever at her desk as she was in the saddle_ wrote a letter on the subject complaining of having been ungallantly used * various ways on the course_ and concluding by challenging Mr. Flint to ride the same match in all its terms over the same course next year.,in,mares,Guineas,Tennysons
