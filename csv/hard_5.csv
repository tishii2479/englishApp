The money_ after considerable difficulty_ having been found_ the chief corner-stone of the building was laid in its place by the Earl of Errol_ on the 16th of January_ 1839_ and the occasion of the opening of the stand was signalised by the presence of Her Majesty_ who sent for the jockey who rode the winner of the Ascot Stakes_ a boy of the name of Bell_ and after complimenting him on his skill and judgment as a rider_ kindly * him with a ten-pound note.,presented,dangerous—ruin,difference,tones

The \"Economist's\" argument is that horse-racing_ despite its evils_ must be tolerated for the good it does to trade_ for the crowds it sends over the railways_ for the gospel of eating_ drinking_ and dressing which it so eloquently preaches_ all employing tradespeople_ and_ consequently_ circulating money.,even,Fulwar,expense,rubies
