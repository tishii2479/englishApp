From the sporting journals of the period a glimpse is obtained of the dealings of Lord Hastings with \"the ring_\" * of the indignation of the magnates of the betting world because of his lordship's disinclination to hedge his \"very fine bets.,and,predominating,wages,respond
\" One journal_ which professed to be well informed of the contents of his lordship's betting-book_ said that the ring would have been well * to have given him a sum of £20_000 for his chances of winning the Derby with Lady Elizabeth_ on the condition that he would devote the money so obtained to part payment of the arrears of his debts of honour—debts contracted on the turf after his liabilities on Hermit's Derby had been provided for.,pleased,draw,vent,undoubted
