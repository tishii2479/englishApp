The author makes no pretensions to teach trainers how to train horses_ or jockeys how to ride them_ and in no sense_ * that it is offered for their perusal_ is the work intended for those who make the \"business\" of the turf the work of their lives the book has been written for other persons and other purposes.,except,certain,formulated,victorious
* is necessary to state this much plainly_ because when a paper or an article pertaining to the \"great national sport\" appears in a review or magazine_ it is at once stigmatised by the sporting journals as containing only \"pipers' news_\" and in the view of the critics it may be so but such articles are not written to instruct the critics_ but to inform the public.,It,chosen,night,Beginning

It will_ perhaps_ be thought by some persons that the dark side of things is too much dwelt upon in the following pages_ that too much is said about the frauds and chicaneries of the turf_ and too little about the brighter aspects of the sport_ but it must be borne in mind that racing has unfortunately become a \"business\" of the most sordid kind the majority of the men engaged in the \"sport\" run their horses only as * of gambling_\" whilst not a few of them to ensure success condescend to practices that will not bear the light of day.,\"instruments,successively,fiercely,begin
