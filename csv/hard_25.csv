In seeking after turf reform_ it must be borne in mind that there are some things which the Jockey Club cannot possibly accomplish but it is undoubtedly the province of that body to regulate racing so far as the ages of horses are concerned they can determine when two-year-olds shall first run_ and they can fix a limit_ as indeed they have already done_ below which the stake to * run for shall not sink.,be,never-ceasing,\"stable,care

Before leaving this part of the subject it may just be noted that there was no lack of two-year-old racing at Newmarket in the years (1882-83) which are selected as * representative.,being,apology,proportionately,fountain-head
From April 11th to 14th six races took place in which two-year-olds were the competitors either in whole or part for these the fields numbered respectively 6_ 8_ 3_ 10_ 8_ and 3.
