By the 12th * October the hunt had progressed up Sand Creek to its source_ and westward across the High Divide to Calf Creek_ where we found a hole of wretchedly bad water and went into permanent camp.,of,state,thorough,accidents

A little bit of Montana—a * square patch from the wildest part of the wild West—has been transferred to the National Museum.,small,continuous,catapult,restriction

In front of the pool_ as if just going to drink_ is the huge buffalo bull_ the giant of his race_ the last * that was secured by the Smithsonian party in 1888_ and the one that is believed to be the largest specimen of which there is authentic record.,one,above—regular,entered,protrude
