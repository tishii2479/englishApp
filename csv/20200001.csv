Some of the details of this story (told by a Muhammadan * are probably quite untrue.,writer),was,granddaughter,Probably

As * have found that_ in spite of appearances_ ‘Ali Muhammad after all wears trousers_ we may perhaps find that his sister_ Rubabeh_ wears a skirt_ and so indeed she does_ but it is so short as not to be very noticeable indoors_ while out of doors it is completely hidden by the big baggy over-trousers_ gathered in at the ankles and footed_ which she wears when she goes in the street.,we,fair,Hikāyat\",kindly
An English missionary once suggested to a young * that a skirt reaching to the knees would look better_ but she said she was not an old woman yet.,woman,suit,prepared,sort
The old women generally * quiet colours and long skirts_ reaching down to the knee_ but young women and girls like something more dressy.,wear,sect,wealthy,coarse

* when she goes out she must put on dark over-trousers which cover everything up to the waist_ and over her head_ in place of the pretty prayer _ she must throw a large black  which hangs over everything_ while a long strip of white cotton hangs down in front of her face with drawn thread work in front of the eyes_ so that she may be able to see without being seen.,But,followed,country,differ
So_ unlike our streets_ the Persian ones get their colour from the men and boys_ while * women and girls supply the darker_ duller element.,the,declared,motive,kitchen

It seems to suggest that no great distinction is made between children and *_ and really there is not as much difference as we find at home.,grown-ups,Christians,naturally,thirty-eight
The children are taught to take life very seriously and are treated as * men and women before their time_ and so they have no time to grow up into proper men and women_ and the result is that we find the children too grown-up and the grown-ups too childish.,little,European,arrived,Missionary

Now Muhammad_ the false prophet whom the Persians believe in and obey_ had no such high standard to set before them_ no such high ideal for them to grow * to_ as our Lord Jesus Christ set before His followers and enables them to grow up to and so his religion provides only a short time for growing up_ and stunts instead of assisting the growth both of individual Muhammadans and of Muhammadan nations.,up,handful,least,fracture
