The Cesarewitch cannot be said to be \"famous\" for its surroundings on the contrary_ the struggle has often enough been accompanied by an evil odour of finesse and chicanery_ consequent on repeated attempts to throw dust in the eyes of the handicapper_ or_ to state more plainly what is meant_ to \"cheat\" that important *.,functionary,the,grades,vogue

The reason why such practices are resorted to is not because the stake which can be won is a valuable one_ as the total amount of the Cesarewitch Stakes seldom reaches £2_000_ but because the race in question affords a * of wagering on such a gigantic scale that horses entered for the contest may_ with caution_ be backed to win even as much as £100_000.
