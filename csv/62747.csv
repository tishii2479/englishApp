They were so uneasy about their father that they could hardly think of anything else_ and they had not yet begun to consider * they_ themselves_ should do.,what,held,wistful,step

Their trouble_ however_ did not prevent * from sleeping well_ and when they went to bed they knew nothing more until long past daylight the next morning.,them,agile,think,knowing
After such a night’s rest things did not appear so bad to the boys as they had seemed the * before_ and they ate a hearty breakfast.,day,unaccustomed,pomegranates,salient

When the matter was finally settled and the boys had decided that they were * the right thing_ they felt easier in their minds and were able to enjoy the strange sights on the boat.,doing,bag,peril,full

On the third day_ August 5_ they reached the large city of Kazan_ where the boat stopped several hours to make a * change of cargo.,considerable,uninteresting,perfectly,burn
The boys * themselves near the gangplank to watch the unloading_ for the city is some five miles from the landing and they thought it too far away to visit.,stationed,small,gaunt,pattern
There was a great deal of animated talking between the * of the boat and the men on the wharf_ and the boys wondered if the Russian roustabouts were always so vivacious.,men,orbs,maintained,huddled

At that moment the officer in charge of the unloading called out sharply and the sailor * along with his load.,hurried,bleakness,for,hung

In the course of the voyage to Astrakhan the boys picked up many Russian words * phrases and soon began to feel that they were prepared to travel anywhere in the empire.,and,sink,vision,from
On August 8 the boat tied up to the wharf * Astrakhan_ where the English-speaking sailor gathered the news and imparted to the boys the information that President Wilson had issued a proclamation of neutrality.,at,frequent,mother,wandering

Sidney asked why Americans should be treated with greater consideration than the citizens of other countries_ and was told that it was because the United States was the only great nation that had remained neutral_ and would probably continue to be * throughout the war.,neutral,unimportant,cheese,support
The boys became quite excited at that *_ and imagined that their father might even then be at liberty.,information,recalled,impetus,trust
Sidney declared that when they arrived at Petrovsk he would try * reach his father with a telegram_ and if he succeeded they would return to Nizhni-Novgorod.,to,ceiling,fact,perform
The captain dashed their hopes_ however_ by telling them that all telegraph lines had been monopolized by the Government_ and that it would be impossible to send a private message * any sort.,of,carrying,dirt,swirling

When they arrived at that port_ where the boys were to leave the boat_ the captain went with them to the chief of *_ taking the sailor along to assist in the conversation.,police,telling,replied,seasoning
The captain assured him that he had seen the order sent to Astrakhan_ and he was certain the Petrovsk official * rue the day that he went contrary to the spirit of those instructions.,would,credit,shelter,however

They had been * there was a daily automobile stage through the pass_ but feared that if they indulged in such luxury_ they would not have money enough to reach home_ so decided to choose the very much slower_ but also very much cheaper_ mode of travel.,told,soap,throughout,has
When * captain learned_ however_ that mobilization of the army was being pushed so vigorously that the Dariel Pass would be filled constantly with moving troops_ he feared that it would not be safe for the boys to attempt that route_ and advised them to give it up.,the,lying,able,pet

There was * a Babel of talk_ and the boys were familiar enough with the sound of Russian to know that a large part of the conversation was in some other language.,instantly,furiously,helpless,know

The chief appeared to grasp his meaning without any difficulty_ and to be rather * by it_ for he made a remark to the surrounding men_ who all laughed_ and the talking began afresh.,amused,swallow,drag,inexorable

Then they were ready to begin their tramp_ and the undertaking_ when it was close at hand_ seemed so * that their courage almost failed them.,formidable,destitute,decided,loss
It was necessary for Sidney to bolster up their declining spirits by declaring again * they would probably not be able to return to Nizhni-Novgorod even if they should wish to do so.,that,gaze,enabled,customary
So they took the road_ or rather the trail_ for beyond Timour Kahn Shoura there * no wagon road_ but only narrow saddle trails that led up into the high plateaux and ranges of the Caucasus.,was,closingin,constantly,bandits
That first day their way was through a succession of narrow_ wooded ravines that were pleasant * than difficult.,rather,vain,journey,failure
The ascent was gradual * was not difficult at any time_ and there was sufficient shade to temper the sun’s rays_ which_ in those southern valleys_ would otherwise have been scorching.,and,patrol,laughed,packed
The boys would have covered the ground more effectively if they had not been somewhat nervous as a * of the events of the preceding night.,result,frontier,hand,family
They fully expected that the men * had tried to enter their room at the inn would waylay them somewhere on the road that day.,who,necessity,quartered,knows
The country through which they passed was ideal for such an enterprise_ for there was frequent and * shelter for an ambush.,abundant,ahead,found,returned
They were_ therefore_ constantly on the qui vive_ and examined rather carefully before passing every * that seemed favorable for an attack from robbers.,spot,rescued,messy,hardihood
Such vigilance retarded * speed_ and they had a feeling that they were making very little progress.,their,balance,step,fragments
The packs_ too_ though not really heavy_ were burdensome_ and toward night made the boys’ legs_ which lately had not been used to tramping_ * distressingly.,drag,gazed,sudden,attendants
\"I guess those fellows at Timmy got scared last night after all_\" remarked Raymond as the day waned and there had been * alarm.,no,widely,handy,covers

When the necessity for alertness_ as they supposed_ was removed_ and the * was relaxed_ they settled down_ feeling too languid to exert themselves further.,tension,hove,wilds,help
Raymond * that he would rather loaf than eat_ and he didn’t care if he never ate again if he only got well rested.,declared,railway,floated,citadel
That was the way they felt when they stopped_ but a very little rest will suffice to make healthy boys conscious of gnawing hunger_ especially when they have eaten very little through the day_ as was the case with Sidney * Raymond.,and,carry,gleaming,winds
Soon both of them began to feel a strong desire to explore the lunch-bags_ but they remembered * dry that lunch was_ and how difficult it would be to eat it without something to wash it down.,how,on,occupy,turbulent
Raymond proposed that they move down * the stream and eat their supper there where the water was handy_ but Sidney told his brother to stay where he was and he would take a large cup with which they had provided themselves and bring water up.,to,bottom,subside,rushed

From the stream_ Raymond allowed his gaze to wander on to the rugged * of the opposite side_ and then up the ravine to the narrow gorge.,mountains,thinnest,its,minds

The men_ who somehow gave the impression of being officials_ placed themselves one on each side of the *_ and taking hold of their arms hurried them along with a brief statement in a strange language that was plainly not Russian.,boys,illumined,south,violent

The day wore on * noon_ and the boys took a lunch from their knapsacks.,past,overtaken,morsels,mined
Though the lunch was extremely simple_ consisting mainly of dry *_ they were able to occupy considerable time in disposing of it_ for very careful mastication was necessary in order to swallow the food without water_ of which there was none.,bread,owners,fillip,shouted
Aside from that diversion there was nothing whatever for them to do while they waited * arrival of night.,the,camps,suggested,breaking
The window looked out against a * wall_ only a few feet away_ and gave them no view of the village.,blank,rode,suit,various
The door was so * thick that it allowed no sound to penetrate.,extremely,loan,rabbit,teeth
Though it opened on the street_ the boys could distinguish no noise of passing feet_ and what appeared strange to them was that the only noise * heard seemed to come from the roof.,they,or,truthfully,overhanging
When the boys were put into the * in the morning_ the whole affair of their arrest and imprisonment had been so hasty and so bewildering that they had not taken note of the fact that the jail was situated against the mountain-side.,jail,mined,allow,distinguish
Above the jail other buildings ran up the steep slope_ and the roofs * the lower lines of buildings formed front yards for the next line of buildings above_ and so on to the top.,of,imagine,result,brow
So the roof of the jail no doubt was occupied_ possibly as a stable for the horse that belonged to the * above.,family,assure,note,whoever
On that plan are built many * the mountain villages of Daghestan_ very like the villages of our own Pueblo Indians.,of,ranges,air,floor
Toward night the English-speaking policeman opened the door * brought in water and black bread_ closing the door after him.,and,easy,articles,splintered

\"I think * got more money_\" said the man with a cunning look.,you,green,dare,become
\"You have lump * clothes.\" And he tapped his breast significantly.,under,dirt,knapsacks,screws
The boys were * much startled by the revelation that the policeman knew they had more money.,very,bridges,noiseless,surge
Raymond_ though excited by the prospect of an easy release_ fortunately had presence of mind to remain quiet and leave the matter in Sidney’s hands_ realizing that one could * it better than two.,manage,accepted,undefined,considering
Sidney * not be sure that the man before them was the only one who knew that all of their money had not been taken away.,could,burn,collect,awake
It was possible that the chief of police was just as well informed_ and there was a prearranged * to get the boys to try to escape.,plan,him,accordingly,crop
Perhaps_ Sidney thought_ there was a custom among the Lesghians similar to the Mexican \"Ley de fuga_\" in plain English_ law of *_ which encouraged a prisoner to escape and then shot him in the act.,flight,fifteen,gained,skull
Possibly any money taken from a prisoner who was killed in that way would not be reported by the chief of police_ and that would be an * for the official to encourage such attempted escapes.,inducement,perplexing,resistless,stimulus
Sidney ran the matter over in his mind so rapidly that only a few moments were * while the man was waiting an answer to his proposal.,consumed,tenaciously,eked,stupor
But he did not dare trust the fellow_ for he realized that if * were once outside the jail there would be nothing to prevent the man from taking whatever money they had_ perhaps putting them out of the way to accomplish it.,they,excited,action,relieved

If they * only obtain a gun of the same caliber_ they would still be well fortified.,could,brothers,dim,affirmation
Sidney admonished his *_ however_ to take no rash chances_ at any time_ in an attempt to procure arms.,brother,greatest,dripped,remove
The black bread which the policeman had brought * them was not at all inviting in its appearance_—indeed it was fairly repulsive_—but they decided to keep it_ for if they were to succeed in escaping from the town in the night_ they would_ of course_ have no chance to buy food.,to,embrace,havent,rinds
So the bread was * away in the knapsacks with the small supply already there.,stowed,black,nostrils,mistake
The boys_ while it was * light_ carefully inspected the window bars so that they would know just what to do in the dark.,still,summons,frontier,afraid
They * not place their hands on them_ for they did not wish anybody who might be watching outside to observe that the bars were being examined.,did,sweep,orchards,officers
They found that the rains which had rusted the bars had_ * course_ run downward_ so that the irons_ while nearly rusted through at the lower ends_ were still very solid at the top.,of,slightly,burdened,terror

Finally it became dark_ and very dark it was_ *_ inside the jail.,indeed,ripening,waste,welcome
But they waited what seemed to them a long time after that_ to * it probable that all stragglers would have returned home.,make,victim,lay,citadel
When they were sure that night was well *_ they began operations on the window bars_ tentatively at first_ to see what resistance they would be obliged to overcome.,advanced,swinging,following,follow

At first that assault made very little impression_ then the bar began to * a trifle.,yield,disturbed,glided,patrol
Suddenly_ with almost no warning_ when Sidney gave an especially strenuous pull_ the iron snapped in two at the bottom_ the upper end dropped out of the hole where it had rested in the masonwork_ and the bar * clattering to the floor.,fell,collect,camps,port

\"The sounder they sleep the *_\" replied Sidney.,better,cover,size,all
With the * iron to use as a lever the other two window bars were quickly broken at the bottom and bent up_ for they did not come loose at the top as the first one had done.,loose,seek,in,bank
Then the boys * their plans carefully so that there might be no slip.,arranged,managed,easily,it

That was easily accomplished; Sidney climbed * without mishap_ and received the blanket rolls which Raymond passed him.,out,flooded,jerk,tribes

Though it was very dark_ it had been so much darker inside the building that * could distinguish objects very well.,he,saving,accompaniment,drew
He saw that they were in a * of an alley_ only a few feet wide_ between the jail and the next building.,sort,lighted,suave,fortunately
Toward * front of the jail it opened out into a wider space which Sidney knew must be a street.,the,delay,dropped,no
The other * it melted into indistinguishable blackness.,way,altogether,snow,consultation
As Raymond was gathering himself up from the ground a man dashed around the front * the jail toward them.,of,warship,bow,pockets
\"Come this way_ Ray_ I’ve got all the plunder_ we can get away from him_\" cried Sidney_ and he ran in the opposite direction_ * by his brother.,followed,whence,anxiously,within
The boys found that * alley climbed up a steep slope_ and they stumbled up the ascent with breathless haste.,the,not,its,bloody
The man who pursued them was shorter_ older_ and * agile_ so_ although he was carrying nothing_ and Sidney_ at least_ was well loaded_ the boys managed to keep ahead.,less,bigger,welldirected,both

Up_ up_ they struggled until their pounding hearts and panting lungs nearly * them.,suffocated,anybody,departure,attached
The walls continued along the sides with no change that was perceptible in the darkness_ and the boys * on what plan the village could be constructed.,wondered,cold,condition,sighted
At last Sidney came to * end of the alley and found there was an opening_ a similar narrow passageway_ to the left.,the,steps,stowed,ornamental
Around that corner the alley extended on a level_ and * made the turn_ Sidney’s road was much easier.,having,seemed,difference,moments
He soon came to a blind wall across * passage_ and groping along its face_ in the corner between that wall and the wall of the alley_ he felt a ladder.,the,dressing,snowcovered,loomed
Sidney hesitated for a moment_ wondering where the ladder could lead_ but as * could find no opening in the wall_ and as he could not well turn back_ he went up it.,he,uneventful,shoulders,supper
After climbing eight or ten feet he stepped over the top * the ladder to a level surface that was apparently a dozen feet or so wide.,of,including,crashed,clinging
At the left there seemed to be only space_ but on the right rose a * in which dimly showed an opening.,wall,gathered,suave,liberal
From down in the alley came the noise * Raymond and his pursuer running.,of,despite,vied,cried
Then for a moment there was a * in the sound_ followed by a heavy thud_ and in another moment the sound of a blow.,pause,shouted,expedited,always
Sidney strained his eyes to see * the gloom below_ to discover_ if possible_ what was happening there.,into,animals,interested,qui
Failing in that he threw his blankets down on the * and grasped the ladder to descend_ fearing that harm had come to his brother.,ground,justify,dense,cloak
As he did so_ one person instead * two came running along the darkness below_ and the figure blundered into the wall at the end.,of,leaped,scene,treated

It did not occur to him for a moment that in appropriating * revolver he was doing practically the same thing that the policeman had attempted when he coveted their money.,the,disturbing,wonderful,remarkable

The * of a possible return to the filthy jail was more than Raymond could endure; he simply must prevent any danger of that.,thought,consuming,ears,dejected
He had a savage_ momentary impulse to shoot the man as he * before him_ but he could not bring himself to do that_ and_ anyway_ it would make too much noise.,lay,fancy,practically,sew

All the conditions were * and mysterious.,weird,metal,donkey,remarkable
The boys stood in the doorway and tried vainly to * the darkness about them.,pierce,trust,precision,shown
The sky was clear and starlit_ but there was no moon_ and the mountains_ which seemingly nearly surrounded them_ were black and without form_ and shut out most * what light there would otherwise have been.,of,desire,sea,spattered
In front of them was the narrow_ level space on which they had * when they climbed the ladder_ and beyond that fell a slope which appeared_ in the gloom_ to be set with knobs.,landed,outcome,arms,crouched

\"What do you make of it_ Sid?\" asked Raymond_ still * a whisper_ for they had a sort of feeling that there were people near.,in,swollen,flag,country
\"I hope he will_ and chase after us.\" While the boys were talking_ they carefully drew the ladder up and laid it *_ well back from the edge.,down,assistants,buckled,mates
Then they * into the room_ opened up their blankets close to the wall on one side of the door_ and in about a minute were both fast asleep.,went,conical,captains,commenting
\"I hardly have the courage to look out of the door_ Ray_\" * Sidney.,said,risk,mountain,suggestion
Raymond had hardly finished speaking when there came in at the door the sound of a voice talking_ seemingly so near that the boys were sure it must be from some person just * the door.,outside,shelter,spelling,securing
Another * replied_ and the two continued in a conversation.,voice,thrown,mounted,handbag
The boys looked at each other * wide-eyed apprehension_ then they raised themselves cautiously from their blankets and stood_ Raymond with his revolver held at full cock.,in,taxed,débris,has
They expected every moment that some one would enter * the door_ and Raymond wondered if it would not be foolish to resist_ after all_ if men came to arrest them.,through,mountains,agile,closing
He could_ without doubt_ shoot a man or two_ perhaps all who came at first_ but * could hardly hope to get away even then.,they,green,seeming,scenery

There he was joined * Sidney.,by,shoulder,question,leaped
For the first time the boys saw the prospect from the door_ for darkness had_ of course_ prevented their seeing anything before * went to sleep.,they,camp,bit,consultation
They observed that the space in front of the room where they had * was_ in fact_ a terrace.,slept,greeted,author,plunging
It was some fifteen feet wide and was * cut square down.,then,activity,menu,aching
The voices which * heard rose from some lower level which they could not see_ apparently close under the wall that descended from the edge of the terrace_ and at no great distance.,they,advance,led,delight
Beyond the level whence came the voices_ however_ the view was unobstructed_ and the boys were amazed by * they saw.,what,afforded,ever,leap
The * slope below them was thickly clothed with houses constructed in terraces_ apparently with no intervening streets_ the front yard of one house being also the roof of the next house below.,steep,arrest,sweeping,present
The buildings were * of rough stone and the walls were not finished smooth with mortar or plaster_ so that_ seen at a distance_ the village might easily be taken for a collection of rocks on the side of the mountain.,all,misery,pursue,atom
On some of the terraces in front of the * they saw horses calmly eating their provender on the roofs of their neighbors.,houses,currents,brothers,locate

The conversation of their neighbors just below continued at intervals_ * the sound of the voices came up to them with great distinctness.,and,indistinguishable,had,bright
The boys imagined the two men who were talking * be sitting in the sun in front of their own door.,to,unusual,laboring,inspected
There were * sounds audible from the rear_ but if there were people above them_ any noise which they made would_ of course_ be heard more readily above than below.,no,nerves,saddle,motion
There were no windows in the room where they had passed the night_ no opening except the door_ and there seemed to be no way * them to obtain a view to one side or the other except by exposing themselves in front.,for,feels,scarce,pillows
\"I’m going to see if I can’t look around the wall to * side without being seen_\" said Raymond_ edging forward on one side of the doorway as far as he could go without actually passing beyond the line of the front wall.,one,sense,years,inexperienced
\"Gee! Sid_\" he exclaimed_ after taking * look_ \"the alley that we came up last night is a street with houses opening on it. But I don’t believe there are any more houses as high up as this one. You take a look.\" And he made way for Sidney.,a,past,off,added
The boys began to realize that they had had no breakfast_ * the situation was not made more cheerful when they remembered that the knapsacks contained only dry bread and cheese.,and,should,south,mates
Moreover_ the cheese was very salty_ and as there was no water they did not dare to eat it_ for fear of creating a consuming thirst which could not * allayed.,be,tightly,sweeping,precisely

They ate that * slowly as possible_ taking very small pieces and chewing each piece a long time.,as,perceptible,events,ugly
Even with such a highly * method as that the meal was only too quickly finished.,hygienic,scooped,cord,car
When breakfast was out of the way_ Raymond took up his new revolver_ which he * not had time to examine.,had,depend,trying,lifted
\"If you do_ I’ll drink some of * rinsing water first. Gee_ but I’m thirsty!\" Raymond found that the gun was a six-shot revolver of English make; rather antiquated in style but in serviceable condition.,the,simultaneously,hurry,insisted
He took it all apart * wiped the pieces and the inside of the barrel carefully with a bit of rag_ polishing the barrel until every atom shone.,and,barrel,unfortunates,visited

\"And here we’ve had to stay all day_\" growled Raymond_ \"with water in the house right * us. I’ve a good mind to go down there now and get a drink.\" For the thought of the possible water so near was almost more than the boy could endure.,below,steady,foliage,movement

The boys rolled up their blankets and disposed of their packs to the best advantage for traveling_ then left their shelter * feverish haste in their longing to reach water.,with,mother,stealthily,kernels
The mountain * which they had to pass was bare_ as all southern slopes are in Eastern and Central Daghestan.,along,attention,cultivated,giving
With practically no growth of bushes_ and with only broken rocks to retard them_ their way was not difficult_ even in * dark_ and they made good progress.,the,quartered,for,opening

However_ to insure security_ they went half a mile farther_ * then descended to the valley.,and,thoughts,narrow,mainland
At * foot of the mountain they encountered a well-traveled trail_ but as it was plain that they had not yet reached the lowest level of the valley_ they decided to continue a little farther on the same line in the hope of finding water.,the,mined,year,date
So they went straight forward and soon * the wash of a stream_ but alas!,crossed,altitude,cutting,bruise

The trail went up to the terminal moraine of the glacier and disappeared_ * the boys assumed that it passed over the mass of broken rocks to the ice.,but,purchased,energy,petitions

\"I’ve had enough bear * this trip_\" declared Sidney_ as they turned back on their tracks.,for,fellows,province,atmosphere
The *_ on arriving again at the moraine_ after some search found that the trail turned to the right_ but was covered with fresh snow_ which was the cause of their missing it.,boys,department,camped,muffled

While the next ravine * not the bed of a glacier_ it contained very much more snow.,was,wall,iron,traffic
At the height to which the boys had reached by that time the storms during the day had been * frequent and more severe_ consequently there was a great deal of fresh snow_ which made traveling very much more difficult.,more,coffeepot,raft,easily
At first * trail climbed along well up on the left side of the ravine_ and in that exposed position it was not filled uniformly with soft snow.,the,preceded,consequently,however
In places the snow * failed to lodge_ or had been swept away by eddying gusts_ and those places came with sufficient frequency to mark the road for the travelers.,had,occasionally,destitute,sister

In that way they were enabled to keep the general direction of the *_ though they were sometimes off it_ in deeper snow than ever.,road,principal,supper,was
At such times when they left the trail_ they frequently plunged down into * snow that was above their waists_ and were obliged to make a desperate effort to get back on the hard foundation.,soft,make,settled,shoulders
Such traveling would have been sufficiently difficult if the * had been unencumbered_ and with the packs they were carrying it was extremely exhausting.,boys,hoped,attached,neverfailing
Once or twice_ when Raymond stepped off into loose snow_ he was obliged to wait for Sidney’s help before he could * back.,get,ploughed,conglomerate,logs
Sometimes_ when the boys sank down in that *_ they would loosen their blanket rolls_ and throw them up_ thus being enabled to crawl out without help.,way,guide,bearing,name
All that occupied * time_ besides taking the strength of the struggling boys_ and the sun sank behind the western peaks and they were still not out of that cañon.,much,actually,settling,penetrated
Then_ too_ as they constantly climbed to higher elevations_ and * trail approached the upper end of the ravine_ it was less exposed to the wind and was more evenly covered with snow.,the,separating,raised,planned
So_ finally_ the boys labored through deep snow without any intervals of * road_ and could only with difficulty keep the trail at all.,good,sarcastic,cheese,whisper

When they missed the road * got up on the glacier by mistake_ Raymond had thought he was not equal to much more_ but with pure nerve he kept to the work_ and for a long time said nothing more about being tired.,and,illumined,perched,serious

At Bezheeta they had obtained bread * a little cheese_ the latter being a great treat_ for they had been some days without any.,and,ought,command,passenger

For drink_ of which * did not care for much_ they melted fresh snow in the cup.,they,fully,ripened,flight
As the boys sat munching their supper * looked out on a very Arctic landscape.,they,occur,her,hunted
They were at the upper end of the ravine they had been following up_ and only a short distance from the summit_ with an outlook that would_ in daylight_ embrace many miles of the * side of the range.,north,obey,rising,steady
The sky had cleared after the storms * the day_ and a full moon_ just above the crests in the east_ flooded with a soft light the rocky cliffs and ravines that were rounded with their covering of white.,of,trouble,thing,flag
The overhanging cliff which formed the boys’ * was draped from its upper edge with frozen snow_ which even hung down in front and gave the appearance of an ice grotto.,shelter,possibility,piling,hot

Even that * picked out in ruddy lights reflected from the fire.,was,realizing,near—but,assemblage
That fire was * saving feature of the whole scene.,the,bear,stand,blind
Outside_ the prospect was one of Arctic desolation_ but inside_ the impression given by the cheerful * was one of comfort and warmth.,blaze,traveling,connected,evading
The boys soon imbibed the cheer of * immediate surroundings_ and were promptly fortified by their supper.,their,officials,get,white
Both of them had been exhausted as much by * as by hard work.,hunger,insure,toward,agreed
Not until they were lying at their ease by the fire_ and felt the rest that is given by food_ did they realize that they had * nothing since they left Bezheeta in the morning.,eaten,prayers,lifegiving,folly
The cold and bleakness of * road had not invited lunches.,the,impulses,steeds,cramped
The wonder was that they * not given out before they did.,had,stirred,favorable,projected
\"Wasn’t the trail covered up * before we stopped_ Sid?\" asked Raymond after they had finished their supper and lay in the warmth.,entirely,peaceful,ideal,launched
\"I hadn’t thought of that_\" * Raymond.,said,handed,safety,sudden
\"That * ages ago_\" said Raymond.,was,instead,whoever,tremendous
\"It does seem a * time.\" And Sidney sighed wearily as he thought of the work back of them.,long,encounter,end,beasts
The weather_ after the skies cleared_ had turned cold very rapidly_ and the night that followed was very frosty_ but the boys_ in * they called their house_ were snug as could be.,what,wrench,taxed,numbed
The cliff served not only as a wall_ but as a roof_ and with the fire * the \"doorway_\" they were well protected.,in,nice,known,sweeping
To be sure_ the fire did not burn all night_ but they kept it up until they were ready to crawl between * blankets.,their,find,leap,assiduously
Then they doubled up their beds * slept close together_ and though the night was the coldest in all their camping experience_ they did not suffer.,and,twenty,tied,throbbed
In the morning it was a short task to build a brisk fire with the stock of dry sticks * had left overnight.,they,wife,listened,law
Indeed_ the fire was more cheerful than the breakfast_ for with a temperature that must have been * near the zero mark_ a cold_ dry meal was not very satisfying.,hovering,flotsam,include,shores

A night’s warm rest_ and food that was sufficient in quantity_ however unpalatable in *_ had restored them completely.,quality,didnt,timbers,wild
They started out_ therefore_ with renewed courage_ and_ as Sidney had predicted_ the summit in the morning light * very near_ as though it were not more than a few hundred yards away.,seemed,led,fed,boy
The boys first sought a place where they might climb * the top of the cliff back of their camp_ and having gained that_ found they were on a ridge that led directly to the summit.,to,exclamation,stern,stew
Even *_ however_ it was not an easy climb.,then,monster,persons,working
The snow_ while not so deep as it had been * the ravine_ was still too deep for good traveling.,in,indignation,even,lunch
The more * fallen snow had been packed just enough to make it resist a little when they stepped on it_ and yet not enough to allow it to support their weight.,recently,heavily,reminded,match

Over that * surface the boys plodded slowly but steadily_ and with good cheer.,yielding,armed,indicate,pierce

In that way_ slowly but surely_ they won * the summit.,toward,greatly,reasons,armed
As they neared the goal their impatience increased until they * ploughing through the snow with breathless haste_ panting and puffing with the effort.,were,separating,timberline,man
Then_ finally_ they stood on the topmost point_ and simultaneously their caps flew * the air_ and they gave three rousing cheers and a tiger.,into,led,sheltering,greatest

And again a day passed * hardly any perceptible accomplishment.,with,dazed,reasonable,square

To the casual observer_ though_ there would have seemed * be still something left.,to,closed,early,surging
The boys were standing on old_ hardened snow that had undoubtedly been in place for many years_ and that was pierced only occasionally by rocks so gray as to be hardly distinguishable * the dingy snow itself.,from,future,passed,jingle
Back of them_ by the route * which they had come through Daghestan_ the immediate slopes were densely covered with snow_ but beyond_ only the high elevations were clothed in their first white robe of early fall.,on,affording,manage,folk

All was glowing and smiling in the tints of summer_ where even autumn_ much less winter_ had not * approached.,yet,handy,plank,day
In the checkerboard of cultivated country there were squares of dark_ rich green * indicated orange groves_ and other divisions of ashy green that proclaimed orchards of olive trees.,that,level,task,capable
It * a glorious and beautiful scene_ and was like a fairy transformation after the barren ranges and desolate slopes of Daghestan.,was,department,often,flash
Beyond that brilliant *_ as though to remind the beholder that all to the south was not soft and warm_ towered the snow-capped mountains of Armenia.,valley,dense,tense,glowing
In the west_ across a jumble * mountains that rose at the upper end of the Georgian valley_ the boys saw a hazy line which they were sure must be the Black Sea_ and their hearts throbbed faster as they looked.,of,required,this,novel
The travelers were viewing * wonderful panorama from a height of fully twelve thousand feet_ and only in the western portions of the range were points that were higher.,the,complainingly,can,labored
To the east the range dropped much lower_ and when the boys turned that way they saw_ off on the dim horizon_ a level line that was_ * doubt_ the Caspian.,without,somewhere,desired,lent
\"No wonder we were cold back there_\" said Raymond_ as he looked over the snowy wastes through which * had passed.,they,sputtering,tied,stand
\"But_ jiminy_ won’t I be glad to get down on that side!\" And he turned with longing to the warmth * beauty of the south.,and,cab,stimulus,tiny
When * boys looked down on the slope immediately below them they saw_ what they had not before observed_ in their enthusiasm over the view_ that the snow did not descend more than half a mile on that side.,the,bringing,collapse,expecting
The trail across the summit was * obliterated_ at least_ the boys could find none; and for a short distance down the south side also_ none appeared.,entirely,landed,years,passage
A little farther down_ however_ the snow was melted along the line of the trail_ leaving it * visible_ while on either side the ground was covered thick.,plainly,inquire,wondered,somehow

Without stopping to hunt any longer for a trail over the top_ the boys started down a * that appeared to intersect the road below.,ridge,happier,strange,do
At first the * was deep_ and the traveling was bad_ but the sun was warm and the air was still_ and soon_ as Raymond had predicted_ they were in slush.,snow,side,accompanied,shooting
That did not last long_ but it was followed by a zone * mud.,of,swell,despite,fastnesses
That_ too_ was soon past_ and by the time the travelers reached the *_ they were walking on dry ground.,road,supreme,civilized,comparison
With exclamations of delight the boys threw * down in the warm sun_ and stretching out at full length_ ate a dry lunch with utmost relish.,themselves,longingly,question,rosy
As soon as that was concluded * took the road again_ with a desire to reach a level that would give a decidedly warmer climate for their next camp.,they,prediction,high,watched
The trail went down the tremendous * wall by a series of switchbacks.,mountain,not,working,ports
Nearly all the time_ as the travelers descended_ they were enraptured * a view of the magnificent panorama that was spread out before them.,with,rested,conditions,hospitable
With all their experience of mountain travel they had never before seen anything to * it.,equal,spoke,helplessly,lowering
If they had ever crossed the Alps in early spring from Switzerland to Italy_ they would have been supplied with a comparison_ though the prospect before them was much grander and more extended than that afforded * the journey down the Alps.,by,recovered,motioning,branches

By night the boys had descended so far that the air was soft and warm_ and they did not need to seek a spot that was sheltered * cold winds.,from,shoulder,coveted,feeling
They chose a level place and spread their blankets * the open_ with only the blue sky overhead.,in,cloak,overpowering,placing
It was * different from their camp of the previous night_ and_ indeed_ as they lay on the ground looking up at the twinkling stars_ it did not seem possible that such a transformation could be reality and not a dream.,very,shot,missed,remarks
The boys_ however_ did not take much time for star-gazing_ and the aching of their muscles all over their bodies assured * that what they had gone through was no dream.,them,him,forgotten,greatest
Their prodigious exertions of the previous days culminated in overwhelming fatigue_ and they had hardly more than lain down when sleep made * oblivious of everything.,them,transformation,junction,pontoons
Sidney and Raymond had camped out so *_ and so rarely with anything more than blankets to place between them and the earth_ that they could sleep on any spot_ however hard.,much,encouraged,announced,rail
If their bed were free * loose rocks they asked nothing more.,from,taller,metal,encourage
Sleep_ such as they had that night_ is a * restorer_ and in the morning the boys felt equal to anything that might be ahead of them.,great,vain,violent,three
The * observed no habitations on the south slope of the range_ and in fact the descent was so short and so precipitous that it would have been impossible for any one to make a home there.,travelers,frenzy,coast,biting
Even the hardy tribes who had established villages in the almost inaccessible mountains of Daghestan would not have had the temerity * attempt a colony on the opposite slope of the Caucasus.,to,go,noticed,tilt
By noon of the next day_ however_ the boys had reached the upper margin of the beautiful valley of the Alazan: a valley where the dwellers conducted water * they pleased_ and that was made luxuriant by the stimulus of irrigation under a warm sun.,wherever,hurry,declivity,globes
There the languid air of a semi-tropic early autumn * laden with the fragrance of ripening grapes.,was,breeze,transitory,longer
A luscious late crop of figs hung heavy * their stems_ and pomegranates had burst their rinds to show the crimson kernels within.,on,having,dishes,thirst
In groves of glossy dark orange trees golden globes gleamed amidst * rich foliage_ and the ashy green of the olives was set thick with the black of ripened fruit.,the,mothers,dread,vied
All was luxurious warmth_ abundance_ and peace_ and seemed to the boys_ after the rugged_ sterile * over which they had toiled_ to be a veritable Happy Valley.,mountains,matter,shook,miles

The Georgians appeared a mild_ gentle folk_ * much more fair of face than their neighbors across the mountain barrier.,and,question,series,tree
It was easy to make the owners of the gardens and groves * that a purchase of fruit was desired_ and a delicious variety was heaped before the boys in return for the silver coin which Sidney tendered.,understand,sat,destroyer,seems
And how * did feast!,they,minimizing,salient,yards
Only one who has been entirely without fruit and vegetables for many days could understand * that abundance meant to the boys.,what,cutting,blocking,provincial
Besides_ the semi-tropical fruits reminded them of their own Southwestern home_ and created a longing of homesickness that was painful in * intensity.,its,swift,families,diagonally
As it was easy * obtain food_ so also there was an open hospitality that made the tramp of two or three days across to Tiflis an enjoyment rather than a task.,to,growing,audible,journey
Possibly the people were * more hospitable than those of Daghestan_ and it may be that the soft air and beautiful surroundings lent to them a seeming of suave courtesy.,not,launch,débris,accomplished
At any rate_ the * thoroughly enjoyed that part of their journey_ and it was the first time that they had felt real enjoyment.,boys,falling,raising,village
While the valleys were filled with luxuriant growth_ fostered by the streams that were conducted * canals over their surface_ the mountains were more forbidding_ and that condition_ also_ reminded the boys of their own Southwest.,in,relate,absolute,defined
They found Tiflis situated where the Kura River emerged from between high * mountains.,bare,fright,difficult,encountering
There ended the long tramp of * of miles_ and the boys paused and looked back at the sky-line of white that marked the crest of the great Caucasus Range over which they had climbed.,hundreds,evidently,curious,currents
As they looked_ and their minds ran back over * way by which they had come_ the distance to the Caspian_ where they had left the steamer_ seemed infinity.,the,declining,frenzy,breeze

At Tiflis the boys saw evidence of war preparations again_ in * of soldiers that were passing in the streets.,companies,victim,oblivious,advantage
They proceeded directly to the railway station_ where they tried_ without success_ to obtain news * the war.,of,wildlooking,local,bring
The railway agent * \"Yes\" to every question they asked_ but that was not very enlightening_ as their questions were varied.,replied,socially,spring,reported
So they purchased second-class tickets to Batum_ and took the * train that arrived.,first,bulk,often,sputtering
Sidney * expected to try to send a cable from Tiflis to their mother in New York_ but the station agent had exhibited such density regarding the English language that he decided to wait until they reached Batum.,had,using,assistance,zone
He believed that in a seaport they would almost certainly find some one who could speak English and who would * willing to help them_ even if the official of the telegraph office could not be made to understand.,be,cleansed,boneheads,floating
It was fortunate that they did not wait in Tiflis_ for when they arrived at Batum they learned that the train they were on was the first one in several days that * been allowed to carry the general public.,had,gathered,bather,sounds
It was not known either how long it would be before it was followed * another.,by,silence,poured,compared
Nearly all the trains were being * by the Government to transport troops that were being massed at the various Black Sea ports it was supposed in anticipation of the opening of hostilities with Turkey.,used,brother,neighbors,swallow
That country_ the boys learned_ still remained neutral_ though her purchase from Germany of two cruisers that * fled for shelter within the Dardanelles had already nearly precipitated trouble with Russia.,had,citadel,occur,soothingly
Sidney and Raymond found their blankets quite as * in a Russian railway coach as on a Russian mountain.,necessary,desirable,pattern,undoubtedly
While the air of the coach was not so cold as that of the mountain_ the surface on which they had to lie was even harder * the surface of the Caucasus.,than,uncertain,difficulty,yourself
With their blankets and their cloaks and their soft Daghestan rug_ however_ they made very comfortable beds * the long seats which extended in their compartment across the coach.,on,difficulties,leaving,faithfully
And with their acquired ability to sleep wherever they might make their beds_ they were ignorant of everything that occurred all night_ * being aroused by any of the jolting of stopping and starting.,not,succession,paralyzed,course
In early morning the train approached the coast of the Black Sea at Poti_ several hours before * arrival at Batum.,its,occupy,pulled,expedited
From that point the railway ran near the shore and the boys found much of interest and amusement in * the varied scenes of the waterfront.,watching,outside,fiery,consideration
Upon the arrival of the train at Batum the boys made their way at once to the *_ and_ with their rolls of blankets slung over their shoulders_ they felt quite as they imagined emigrants must feel.,docks,living,surely,pursue
There was much freight on the docks_ great stacks of lumber and * of hides waiting to be shipped_ but there were very few boats tied up there.,bales,thread,grander,face
The first ship which they came to was a small steamer where there were a couple * sailors talking in a language that sounded strangely familiar to the boys_ and yet which did not seem_ after all_ to be one with which they were acquainted.,of,lie,escape,ultimate
They stopped and listened and * more puzzled than ever.,were,here,fixed,barely

\"It’s mighty curious Spanish_ if it is_\" * Sidney.,replied,safe,importantlooking,selfrestraint
Sidney then asked one of the men in Spanish where they were going_ and the * replied promptly in his own tongue that they were going to Rome_ a reply of which the boys gathered the meaning very clearly.,man,considered,habitations,equal
The next attempt_ however_ was not so *_ possibly because Sidney embodied too much in his question.,successful,caller,stumbled,indescribably
He asked the sailor when they were going to leave_ * if he thought their captain would take some passengers.,and,storm,valuable,across
The man * puzzled for a moment_ and then replied in a statement that sounded very long and intricate to the unlearned ears of the boys.,looked,pushing,rocky,mass
While they were considering and * to select words at whose meaning they might guess_ a voice spoke behind them in perfectly plain English.,trying,presence,fully,sky
The boys wheeled and saw * stocky_ middle-aged man.,a,seats,loose,width

The anticipation of sending a message had been so pleasant_ and when that hope was suddenly *_ their loneliness and homesickness were greater than ever.,dashed,sick,hunter,edge
When they arrived at the docks the boys saw a small_ dingy steamer_ that ordinarily would have appeared anything * attractive_ but to the boys then she seemed finer than a big Atlantic liner.,but,really,gait,kicked

There was plenty of water_ however_ * soap_ and the scrubbing that followed was very thorough_ and resulted in two well-renovated boys.,and,agile,stragglers,placid

There was the great city of Constantinople on one side_ * the beautiful heights of Scutari on the other_ both of which places they would have loved to visit.,and,skin,acquired,sometimes
