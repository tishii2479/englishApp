At the time indicated (1820 to 1845)_ the parishes * St. George's and St. James' swarmed with gambling-houses_ where large or small sums of money could nightly be gained or lost_ as might happen_ and the play at the majority of such houses was well known to fall out largely against the players_ as by many well-planned devices the bankers had points in their favour.,of,\"lot,receives—it,egotistical

Coming back to the doings of my hero_ it has to be stated with regard to Crockford that_ although at one period he was in possession of a stud of race-horses_ among the lot being Sultan_ which made some mark on the turf_ he never took a great amount of interest in the noble animal_ preferring to regard it_ like many other men_ as an instrument of gambling but the owner of the St. James' * was well versed in turf chicanery of all kinds_ and knew in his day most of the prominent spirits of the racing world.,gambling-house,cruel,distributed,requisite

Another branch of turf business which Crockford conducted at one time was that of \"squaring\" the books of smaller betting men than himself he could always be relied upon_ even at the last moment—that is_ immediately before a race—to lay the odds against such horses as a bookmaker was \"bad\" against_ and required therefore to back back again_ so as not to run greater risk * was compatible with an honest desire to meet engagements_ and pay what was seen to be due after the race was determined.,than,governs,holds,lady

These gentlemen (the bookmakers)_ especially those of them engaged in extensive ways of business_ are_ it has been often affirmed_ but such statements must be accepted with reserve_ able to manage any kind of turf chicanery—money on the turf_ as everywhere else_ being pretty well omnipotent and therefore_ it has been said_ should one of the fraternity find he is likely to lose £10_000 by the victory of a particular animal in a given race_ he thinks it well worth his while (and no sin) to * with a few hundred pounds to have the animal made safe_ an operation that_ as has been hinted_ can be achieved in various ways.,part,money-seeking,—did,'andicap
