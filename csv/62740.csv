Near the entrance of the great circus tent there was * little man in a canvas chair.,a,lateness,within,August
He sat at the * of the long alley_ which was hung with painted signs.,end,eagle,week,gateway
I had no money to see any wonder_ and so had to be content with what * displayed outside.,was,tearing,orders,snow
It * early in the morning.,was,whole,iniquity,picture
The grass before the tents had not * been trodden down; few persons were about_ and I had the marvels of this fantastic alley to myself.,yet,copper,skillful,gentleman
I had advanced slowly along every foot of it_ and now I stood just beyond the roped-off entrance to the big tent_ and the little man * the canvas chair.,in,headquarters,company,hospital
There * something in the appearance of this man that drew my eye.,was,cased,almost,volume
He sat in the chair as though every muscle were relaxed_ his eyes closed_ his * drooping.,head,bankcracker,member,tragedy
Now * then he put up his hand and pressed the fingers over his face.,and,Doctor,eliminative,keys
It seemed a habit_ as though his * had the sensation of being swollen.,face,brings,principle,mirror
He had been there for * time.,some,6,knotted,false
I had noticed him at the end of the * when I arrived_ precisely in this posture_ as of one worn out with some exertion.,alley,deserted,arunnin,appreciation
I was looking at him as I had looked at the painted signs when the canvas of the big tent was thrust up * a man came out.,and,astonished,middle,resort
He was a big young man in the overalls of a mechanic * he had some device in his hand like a dome-shaped metallic box.,and,anticipate—always,suspected,attached
He * directly to the man in the canvas chair.,went,drawer,usual,ancient
\"Mooney_\" he said_ \"there’s * wrong with this damned thing; make it go.\",something,hanged,gummeddown,various
The little * opened his eyes without moving a muscle of his body.,man,painted,consideration,Littlewood
Then he put out his hand_ took the metallic device_ rested it on his knee_ flicked a penknife out of his waistcoat *_ and with a screw-driver blade took a plate off at the bottom of the thing.,pocket,Major,perplexed,really
Then he adjusted something deftly inside_ replaced * plate and returned the device to the mechanic.,the,holding,lower,clear
It had taken only a moment; his fingers had * with the precision of a pianist_ and he had scarcely changed his position.,moved,Ah—er,seeking,product

And when I looked up_ the eyes of the big mechanic * on me; he had a hard_ determined face and a sharp_ piercing eye.,were,straining,organisms,copper
I felt that he easily summed me * and had the measure of me.,up,curious,entrance,wound

On the table before him were a number * railroad folders and a map_ and he was making some calculations on a blank sheet of paper.,of,tents,thicket,yourself—could

I was completely puzzled_ but_ as you will * realize_ I was ready for almost any adventure.,presently,harsh,northwestern,proofread

As I have said_ I was ready for nearly any adventure_ but especially an * directed against a government with which we had lately been at war_ and which was still_ one felt_ a potential enemy.,adventure,stables,Meet,precise

I went out like a person who has suddenly fallen from the commonplace world into some story of the * Nights.,Arabian,spigot,discussed,unfolded
There was about me and over the world * haze of adventure.,a,dynamite,blocked,stooping
The details of this adventure were not clear_ but it was one directed against the * Mexican government_ and it involved a treasure like the treasure of the sunken Armadas.,crooked,ashes,Yellow,pane
It was * alluring stuff of the storybooks.,the,headed,employment,certificates
I was ready for * with these strange adventurers.,it,spoke,distinguished,especially

After my father’s death_ as I was * alone_ I came down out of the great blue mountains to seek my fortune_ as the storybooks say.,now,twodollar,drifted,desert
I walked_ and on the road I was overtaken by * adventure.,an,suppose,reserve,variety
Near a little village I passed one of those local trains_ common to this country: an engine_ one or * cars_ and an old passenger coach.,two,acceded,competent,fashionable
The highway passed close beside the track_ and as I trudged along a fireman leaned out of the tender and called * me.,to,mood,solicit,velvet
I told him with some heat_ that I would ring his neck if he came down out of his * box_ and I went on.,iron,use,facetious,Chancelleries
But * thing was not ended.,the,ponderously,clocks,agency
The train presently pulled * and_ as it passed_ the fireman threw a lump of coal at me.,on,fictitious,others,promise
I countered at him with a stone_ that missed the tender and struck the passenger * behind it.,car,as,dumped,possibility
At the next village I was arrested and * before a justice of the peace.,taken,move,domeshaped,backward
There I was told that it was * felony_ under the laws of the state_ to throw a stone at a passenger train_ and that the railroad intended to put me into the penitentiary.,a,ones,marble,thinking
\"And what are you going to do with the fireman * threw a lump of coal at me?\",who,frozen,glance,brokenhandled

A railroad detective sat beside me; the fireman who had made the * lolled in the door.,charge,boy,hardens,windswept

You will see then how ready I was for any adventure—and especially if a * was included.,railroad,pure,waved,cant
It had become_ by virtue of the injustice of this incident_ * enemy open to revenge.,an,railway,paused,Captain
I had no trouble to find * dinner_ but I found myself beset with difficulty about the piece of pipe.,a,condensing,game,weary
I tramped about the town during the afternoon_ but I could think of no place where a piece of quarter-inch pipe could * obtained.,be,administer,permitted,womb

Finally in a blacksmith shop I * a rusted rod that had been part of a wagon brake.,found,Additional,lie,injury

Naturally_ he wished to know what I was going to do with it_ and * a moment I was in difficulty for an answer.,for,store—about,runabout,disappointed
Then I told him that they wanted such a piece of iron out at the circus_ and had promised to give me a ticket in * I could find it.,if,fees,consistent,submission
\"I’m glad_\" he said_ \"that there’s something else they want_ * the elephant ain’t thirsty.\",if,orderly,leaving,last

We came finally to the * track.,railroad,being,enemy,transcribe
There was a short switch with a * red house beside it.,little,framed,constructed,limit
It was less a house than a sort of * with a low door.,box,masked,stair,Bad
Leaning against this *_ when we arrived_ was Mooney.,door,reply,rock,status
He was smoking a *; the tiny point of light had been visible to us as we approached.,cigarette,prosecuting,produced,hurtled
I drew the rod * of my sleeve and handed it to him.,out,hay,wizard,abroad

He thrust the rod through the bow * the padlock and with a quick twist broke it out of the lock.,of,screen,Court,brutes
Inside was a hand car_ * then it was that I realized why these men were concerned to have what they called a \"husky\" assistant.,and,circine,car,concerned
It was with difficulty that * were able to get the car on the track.,we,liked,resent,hardened
Finally it was accomplished and we started away * the darkness.,in,washed,they,Buddhist

He had under * what looked like a feed sack_ filled with something that had a considerable bulk.,him,lingchi,Gregory,servant
He carried also the iron rod in * hand_ but it had served his purpose.,his,public,Strange,questionable
At the first stream * crossed he tossed it into the water.,we,wolf,heart,usual
It was a piece of possible evidence and he did not wish it to be picked * along the track.,up,have,codicil,payment
True_ * connected neither him nor White with the thing which we were undertaking_ but perhaps I might be remembered by it_ and it was this man’s policy to leave no point at which any one could begin with his investigation.,it,thumb,District,paragraph
We went * for some time into the night.,on,reject,dumb,days

Then he put his hand through and unbuttoned the latch_ * the window and climbed in noiselessly like a cat_ got the ax and came out.,opened,yourself,sputtered,bore
We were very near to our destination_ it proved_ and in half an hour we reached a * tank.,water,discriminating,collection,need
It was * a little creek and in a strip of wood.,near,linen,exertions,circumstances
I had judged that we were on our * to a water tank from the few lines Mooney had shown me_ and what he had said.,way,weirdly,evade,clock
The money of the Mexican government would be on a train that would stop * for water_ and_ like the pirates of the Spanish Main_ it was our affair to capture the treasure.,here,perpendicular,primly,watchful
Mooney got down * removed from the car a bundle upon which he had been sitting.,and,repair,his,deception
White and I upended the hand car and sent it down the embankment into the thick bushes; then we * around behind the water tank to prepare for the undertaking.,moved,puzzles,displaying,impostor
The night had long * to be dark.,ceased,associates,formulated,shouting
There was no moon_ but the sky was sown with stars_ and there was a sort of * white light in the world.,faint,thoroughly,tired,vaguely
We could see distinctly what we were about_ even in * thicket behind the water tank_ shaded somewhat by the wood.,the,flesh,across,placed

White was to use * ax in order to break in the door of the express car.,the,fatigue,recalled,You
He_ Mooney_ would be the gunman_ and it was my part in the business to stand * the platform between the express car and the next passenger coach to keep back the conductor or any one else who might attempt to go forward into the train.,on,darkhaired,handful,brutes
