Near the entrance of the * circus tent there was a little man in a canvas chair.,great,striking,hardship,identity
He sat at * end of the long alley_ which was hung with painted signs.,the,crossbars,at,mission
I had no money to see any wonder_ and so had to be * with what was displayed outside.,content,hidden,haze,increasing
It was early in * morning.,the,salary,takes,struggling
The grass before * tents had not yet been trodden down; few persons were about_ and I had the marvels of this fantastic alley to myself.,the,shared,entity,payment
I had advanced slowly along every foot of it_ and now I stood just beyond the roped-off entrance to the big tent_ and the little man in the * chair.,canvas,murmured,though,column
There was something in the * of this man that drew my eye.,appearance,explosion,adequate,considered

It seemed a habit_ as though his face had the sensation * being swollen.,of,wax,child,etching
He had been * for some time.,there,those,began,traced
I had noticed him at the end of the alley * I arrived_ precisely in this posture_ as of one worn out with some exertion.,when,crashing,huge,reply
I was looking at him as I had looked at the painted signs when the canvas of the * tent was thrust up and a man came out.,big,ridiculous,received,shadowing
He was a big young man in the overalls of a mechanic and he had some device in his hand like a dome-shaped * box.,metallic,spoken,thoroughly,intellectual
He * directly to the man in the canvas chair.,went,inactivities,enchantment,by
The little man opened his eyes * moving a muscle of his body.,without,riding,definite,job
Then he put out his hand_ took the metallic device_ rested it on his knee_ flicked a penknife out of his waistcoat pocket_ and with a screw-driver blade took a plate off * the bottom of the thing.,at,knows,less,copies
Then he adjusted something deftly inside_ replaced the * and returned the device to the mechanic.,plate,heavylidded,sentenced,minutely
It had taken only a moment; his fingers had moved with the * of a pianist_ and he had scarcely changed his position.,precision,track,slope,break
I had been greatly interested and had drawn * little closer.,a,files,narrowed,directed
And when I looked up_ the eyes of the big mechanic were on me; he had * hard_ determined face and a sharp_ piercing eye.,a,manipulated,court,quizzical
I felt that he easily summed me up * had the measure of me.,and,emergency,brokenhandled,lately
The * man in the canvas chair spoke as the mechanic turned away.,little,memories,display,beset

On the table before him were a number * railroad folders and a map_ and he was making some calculations on a blank sheet of paper.,of,midnight,composed,dogs

I was completely puzzled_ but_ as you will presently realize_ I was ready for * any adventure.,almost,plateau,eh,restrictions

The little nervous man_ Mooney_ regarded me searchingly for * moments before he spoke.,some,summer,agent,drawn
As I have said_ I was ready for nearly any adventure_ but especially * adventure directed against a government with which we had lately been at war_ and which was still_ one felt_ a potential enemy.,an,console,semaphore,pull
Mooney leaned back * his chair and regarded me for some time_ his hand moving about his face.,in,flung,ring,cell—three
He took a paper dollar out of his * pocket and handed it to me.,waistcoat,unknown,permit,righteousness
I went out like a person who has suddenly fallen from the commonplace * into some story of the Arabian Nights.,world,porters,equipment,children

I walked_ and on the road I was overtaken * an adventure.,by,fields,eh,replace
Near a little village I passed one of those local trains_ common to this country: * engine_ one or two cars_ and an old passenger coach.,an,prepared,arms,bedded
The highway passed close beside the track_ and as I trudged along a fireman leaned out of the tender and * to me.,called,village,macadamized,twice

At the next village I was * and taken before a justice of the peace.,arrested,exclamation,degrade,straight
There I was told that it was a felony_ under the laws of the state_ to throw a stone * a passenger train_ and that the railroad intended to put me into the penitentiary.,at,precise,speech,roller

It had become_ by virtue of the injustice of * incident_ an enemy open to revenge.,this,main,map,extraordinary
I had no trouble to * a dinner_ but I found myself beset with difficulty about the piece of pipe.,find,formulate,fancy,modern
I tramped about the town during the afternoon_ but I could think of no place where a * of quarter-inch pipe could be obtained.,piece,weapon,halfway,particular

I got out of the crowd and * him.,followed,picked,discovering,impassive
We went around the * tent_ through the stables for the horses_ then struck out across the meadow in a direction opposite from the town.,big,sheet,gorgeous,almost

He thrust the rod through the bow of the padlock and with a * twist broke it out of the lock.,quick,signaled,unfortunate,condition
Inside * a hand car_ and then it was that I realized why these men were concerned to have what they called a \"husky\" assistant.,was,gratefully,types,deliberate

At the first stream we crossed * tossed it into the water.,he,clenched,greatly,halfburned
It was a piece of possible * and he did not wish it to be picked up along the track.,evidence,mattock,bulb,incisive
True_ it connected neither him nor White with the thing which we were undertaking_ but perhaps I might be remembered by it_ and it was this man’s policy to leave no point * which any one could begin with his investigation.,at,lawn,trainmens,know
We * on for some time into the night.,went,clergyman—threadbare,respect,payment

There was hardly any sound except that * the car on the rails.,of,subject,tampered,haze

She * viciously on White when he came up.,turned,symbols,enforcing,outwit
\"You are a *_ Maggie_\" he said.,fool,saw,pearls,submit
She turned suddenly toward * as though she had not noticed me before.,me,miles,preliminary,lions
And she went out * the entrance to the circus tent_ following the big white horse that carried the fairy.,toward,field,able,abstinence
White said only * few words to me when she was gone.,a,immaculate,telephone,overalls
I traveled with the circus as one might travel with a * caravan.,fairy,he,owner,common
Everything was of the deepest * newest interest.,and,alone,insistent,sauntered
But the greatest wonder was the girl * rode the white horse.,who,departure,supper,sprang

Once or twice I saw her looking curiously at me when I * the horse to help the girl into the saddle.,brought,cavernous,impaled,gun
Sometimes she talked * Mooney.,with,disturb,invalidity,bar
I suppose a week passed in this fashion; then one evening_ as I * helping to bed down the horses_ White came into the tent.,was,sound,hunt,thread
The evening performance had ended * it was perhaps midnight.,and,snapped,tense,educational
\"We are going to take * little motor ride_\" he said.,a,lids,urgency,stooped

It was late and the lights of the street had * put out.,been,deeplined,glass,stuff
We * finally before a garage in a lot between two houses.,stopped,headlight,gaunt,astonishment
The door to the garage was locked and White turned the lock * some implement which I could not see.,with,careless,accustomed,unconvinced
Then we * inside and carefully pushed the car out into the street.,went,guard,overheard,effectively
White * the door again behind us.,locked,net,looks,threshold
We pushed the car along the street for perhaps a hundred * before we got in.,yards,makes,latest,simultaneously
The man understood * motor perfectly and we slipped along the street and out of the town.,the,include,enthusiasm,content
At a bridge on the outskirts we picked * Mooney.,up,dogs,avoid,lead
He * his bundle as on our first adventure.,had,relation,railway,inventor
White ran * car at great speed for perhaps two hours; then we pulled up by the roadside and stopped.,the,adhered,false,adequate
Before we got out of the car I had * explanation of Mooney’s occult device against the bloodhound.,an,spread,bringing,crisp

Mooney * a flash light out of his pocket.,took,disguises,magnificence,deepseated
It was not the usual * affair.,cylinder,manner,stairway,awhile
It was_ rather_ a little squat lantern with a bull’s-eye bulb; * so_ I imagine—for there was a powerful light concentrated on the small disc and it_ therefore_ required a considerable battery.,thick—necessarily,naming,poker,doctor

The road_ as I have said_ ran parallel to * track.,the,lived,came,placidity
We got out now and went directly across the field * the railroad.,to,moment,stopping,three
Here_ close beside the track_ Mooney set up a piece of * cross tie.,rotten,inevitably,cathedral,witnesses

Then he * back along the track.,walked,lookin,sell,serious
I was perhaps at * more than half a mile that we came to a semaphore.,something,almost,stuttering,bound
It was only in the knowledge of future events that I * what we were about to do; and it is in the light of this knowledge that I am able to describe what happened.,understood,knoll,train,company
The men had determined to hold up the * passenger train from Washington to New Orleans.,through,smiled,come,derelicts
Their original intention was to stop this train at a water tank but for some reason they gave up this plan; I think it was because knowledge of the * train robbery made them fear that the usual stopping places would be watched.,other,peril,accustomed,instant
So they determined * another device.,upon,neighboring,her—thats,bottom
A macadamized road paralleled * railroad track and they decided to commandeer a motor car_ follow the track to some isolated point_ and there stop the train.,the,fails,organisms,outlined
This road had what is known as the block system of signals; that is to say_ every mile * the track there was a semaphore which informed the engineer whether or not there was another train in the same block or on the same track.,along,shaken,type,waited
It was Mooney’s plan to short circuit two of the wires of the semaphore and * such connection that the red light would show.,make,security,six,completed

But the semaphore arm kept turning around and around and * not stop.,would,telephone,ghostly,forefinger
It was the ingenious Mooney who found * way out of this difficulty.,a,ditch,lie,departed
When White found out that the semaphore could be thus managed he left it as it was_ restoring * proper connections.,its,illomened,cursed,hieroglyphics
Mooney * practically the same outfit we had used on the previous occasion_ except that he had invented a new kind of mask.,had,knees,date,envelope—sealed
This mask was made so that it was placed in the hat * could not be seen.,and,railroad,lucky,inquire
It had a hem at the bottom_ entirely around_ and filled with * so that_ immediately on lifting the hat_ the mask dropped over the face and stayed there.,shot,cobwebs,performance,discovered
There were no holes in it except two round * for eyes.,ones,instinct,sacks,necessary

In order to make no mistake_ it was the plan * this man to sit fast until we heard the through train blow for a station_ two miles away.,of,society,thrown,sharp
That * give us time to fix the semaphore.,would,wreaths,tight,exquisitely
It seemed a long time as * sat there in the darkness waiting for the train; but it was perhaps_ in fact_ less than half an hour.,we,depends,mold,pellets
Directly we heard the whistle in the distance and we went down to the track; White had got a piece of fence wire and he now climbed the pole and tied the * semaphore arm down over the green and white lights.,red,exactly,appeared,employees
Mooney went about fifty yards along the track in the direction * which the train was coming_ and waited at the place where he thought the engine would stop.,from,place,whisked,exists

But our * were not accurate.,calculations,desperado,bounce,chances
Instead of the engine stopping where we * it would_ it ran on for at least a hundred yards past the red light.,thought,information—such,pleased,war
There was a fog_ and the * did not see the red signal soon enough.,engineer,nevertheless,either,information

The engineer was following * rule of the road that one must not under any circumstances run past a red light.,a,distribution,constable,ascended
Mooney climbed into * engine and took charge of the fireman and engineer.,the,freshen,grinding,eyed
They made no resistance to the masked man * a weapon in his hand.,with,volunteer,sheets,tragedy
White rushed in and uncoupled the mail and * cars from the rest of the train.,express,adore,comprehend,tonneau
Now_ on these through first-class passenger trains_ a power velocipede_ or what is known in the dialect of the road as a \"gasoline speeder_\" is * carried in the baggage car.,always,imagined,whose,chewed

I did not understand what the thing meant at the time_ but I called to White and he came out from behind the * cars.,two,wondered,tried,picks

The man turned with the vehicle in his hands_ thrust it back into the baggage car and dropped where he stood_ his face *_ by the side of the track.,down,indignant,effectively,vindicated
By this time the passengers began to come off to see what * happened to the train.,had,longdistance,sum,swirl

He ordered every one back into the train and began to fire along the * to hurry them into the covering of the cars.,sides,curling,acted,redistribute

In the whirl of these events I seemed to be little more than * spectator.,a,chanced,middleaged,true
To the train crew I was the third menacing figure_ masked and armed_ but I am not certain what benefit I would have been to the * men in a sudden emergency.,two,route,circumstantial,separated

In every detail White handled the * with skill.,engine,thing,insidious,rather
Long afterward I realized fully what * was about.,he,awkward,spent,associates
Before we got down he put on the injector and filled the boiler with water up to the third gauge so there would be no danger of its running dry and burning out the * sheet.,crown,platinum,slipping,intent

When we were on the * he gave me definite orders.,ground,crowned,throttle,while

He even stopped to show me how the weapon worked_ slipping back the top of it with * hand so that_ cocked and released_ I had only to pull the trigger with my finger.,his,glossy,starched,packages

He had wrapped the packages * currency in old newspapers and laid them on the floor of the car.,of,serial,typically,neglected

The two men were gone a long *; disappointed in the express_ they had searched the registered mail.,time,bring,examination,exact
As I stood there on * track before the engine I had a strange sensation.,the,revenge,measure,touch
It was very still; there was a ghostly fog_ * somewhere beyond me_ as though out of the sky_ I heard whispering voices.,and,doing,smock,imagines

And_ as it *_ they were in very grave danger.,happened,sell,minutes,manage
The posse that gathered_ seeing them on the top of the car_ opened * fusillade.,a,reason,preceding,selected
It was very lucky that the idea occurred to Mooney_ for_ as it happened_ these men drew * the suspicion of the officials.,all,flaps,sheet,father

When we got to * car Mooney again turned his lantern on the clock.,the,perquisites,sank,eyed

It was the distinguishing uniform of the * crew_ and now with Mooney wearing the engineer’s cap it seemed to me that we had simply marked ourselves for certain identification.,train,imagine,electronic,amazed
But it was * reflection of inexperience.,the,library,office,money
Mooney_ when he looked at the clock_ foresaw what we were certain to meet on the * and he skillfully prepared for it.,road,drill,temperature,instrument

Suddenly_ it seemed to me_ a light loomed in the road_ * another_ and in a moment we had come into a crowd of motor cars_ trucks_ and the like_ packed with men.,and,reversed,voice,laugh
It was the posse that Mooney knew would come out from the town in the unexpected lapse * time.,of,expressman,roll,advisable
He foresaw that the train crew would get the information of the holdup to the town and it was this posse that we must * prepared to meet.,be,incisive,done,addressed

I do not mean that the result of it was so * or that it was attended by peculiar adventures.,remarkable,touch,want,necessary

Now_ the man naturally in life was stooped_ and with a weary_ nervous *_ as though every motion were an effort.,appearance,smile,armed,student
This attitude_ as I have come to know_ was * languor of a drug and his common appearance was the result of the use of it.,the,begin,my,lot
But to-day_ by some powerful effort_ or perhaps by virtue of an excessive injection of the * itself_ his whole manner had changed.,drug,chance,automatic,metal
Of course the appearance of the man was merely the result of the make-up_ amazingly skillful_ * he had undertaken for the thing he had in hand.,which,ride,yawned,giving
He explained to me that they had finally * the treasure train and that they were going to hold it up to-night.,located,strained,distribute,obtain

When * wax seals on the packages were all thus softened and lifted up without being broken_ he opened the envelopes by rolling the point of a pencil carefully along under the flap.,the,settled,stroke,surely
There were quite a number of these envelopes_ all consigned to one bank and_ while they all contained new currency_ the men were astonished to discover that this currency was in * bills.,small,drugged,forth,arising

This information may have been given out to the Department with the primary intention of leading it to look for the train robbers at a point distant from that at which they were intending to * their criminal operations into effect.,put,ditch,guilt,instant

The two detectives went * this company.,to,safer,apparently,up—the

They would_ then_ have the person from whom they had obtained the note write his name * it so that it could later be identified as having been received from this man White.,on,hour,held,heart
In * manner they finally got a number of bills bearing the serial numbers of the notes which had been taken in the train robbery.,this,national,thick,practically
But this was all the evidence they * able to obtain.,were,awaking,tight,shadowing
Finally * investigations in other directions all failed to bring anything more to light_ they determined to arrest White.,when,facility,false,son
Accordingly one * they followed him when he got on a street car at his machine shop_ and when he got down_ at some place of business in the city_ they stepped up to him and asked him if his name was White.,day,leather,occasion,arranged
He said it was; they then asked him to go with them to help in regard to * forgeries.,some,complete,immediate,few
White very willingly said that he would be glad to help them * any way he could and would go if they insisted; but that he knew nothing about any forgeries.,in,conceal,skilled,pitched

He did not know the names of the two men_ * gave precisely their description.,but,speaker,observations,way
The two government detectives remained * and they determined upon an old experiment.,unconvinced,shows,insure,wildly

Then they went out_ returned * the rear entrance and placed themselves where they could watch the man in the cell.,by,passers,rate,apply
Here White_ now very much concerned_ fell unconsciously into habits which he had acquired in similar surroundings.

The two government detectives watched him for a few minutes_ then * went out.,they,attempt,ate,located
They decided that White must have a penitentiary record somewhere on account of his actions * the cell.,in,cell—three,long,remove
The two detectives went down * the telegraph office and sent a message to every penitentiary in the United States_ giving an accurate description of White_ and the holdup in which they believed him to have taken part.,to,thrust,wrong,guard
They received a reply from the warden of a penitentiary in the northwest_ saying * a man answering that description had served time for train robbery.,that,evening,probably,ended
The detectives now determined to take White north * trial.,for,imagined,shall,skill
On * trip White escaped from the custody of the officials.,this,shared,drafts,subject

The * detectives were traveling with White in the stateroom of a pullman.,two,dead,rumble,being

This door to the stateroom was now about half open and the government detective was standing * the door.,in,solicit,gas,labors
White had barely space enough to pass behind this door in order to reach * lavatory_ but he edged himself deliberately through without arousing the slightest suspicion.,the,obey,halfpast,amused

These two men were perhaps the most accomplished highwaymen that ever operated in any country_ and yet something unforeseen—something they seemed unable to anticipate—always interfered to * them from obtaining the great fortune they expected.,prevent,receipts,nodded,expressed

Then * looked about for a lodging house.,he,stranger,dwindling,strength
He was afraid to go to a hospital; and_ yet_ from what Maggie afterward said_ Mooney was even then_ in the first few hours of * illness_ certain that he had reached the end of his career.,his,neither,arrange,determine
The man had * difficulty in finding what he was looking for; but here he was met with one of those inexplicable vagaries of chance for which there seems to be no adequate explanation.,no,previous,unforeseen,restraint
It was night * Mooney got out of the cab and was helped into the lodging which he had selected.,when,summoned,alone,crowded
In the preoccupation of his illness he did not very closely * the person who maintained this lodging house.,regard,scattering,port,amazement
But in the * when the man came up to the room Mooney knew him instantly.,morning,gigantic,unsigned,hump
Years before * a holdup in which Mooney had been engaged there had been a German mail clerk.,in,endowed,broadcast,shuddered
More than once when Mooney had been in the mood of reminiscence I had heard him talk about this ridiculous person; a pale mild-mannered German_ who had been simply unnerved with terror when the * had entered the mail car.,bandit,foundling,locations,tools—a

Mooney used to laugh about it; about the ridiculous appearance the * presented and what he had done.,creature,pretty,editions,stars
He had pulled an empty mail sack down over the man’s head and shoulders and left him there; and there he had been found three hours later when the train pulled into * of the central cities of the west.,one,master,wire,quizzical
The German had not moved and the mail sack was still pulled down over his shoulders when the train * at the station came into the car.,men,least,tripped,feed
The man had been laughed out of the service and had gone from one undertaking to another_ until_ *_ destiny established him here in this boarding house to meet Mooney when he should arrive ill in a hired cab.,finally,things,clothes—and,restrained
Mooney_ as I have said_ knew the man instantly_ but it was not likely that the man recognized the awe-inspiring bandit in his * lodger.,sick,turpentined,commemorating,leaves
But he looked at Mooney as at * person whom he had seen_ and the highwayman knew that it was only a question of time until his host would be able to place him.,some,anchored,propose,plenty
The impressions of fright are * vivid.,conspicuously,down,keeping,hilltop
It was certain that this man’s mind retained the precise picture of the one who * put him into such abject terror.,had,last,whipped,industrial

It would * merely a question of the mental connecting up of his impressions about this lodger whom_ he felt_ he had seen somewhere_ and the identity of the highwayman who had put him so desperately into fear.,be,garage,decided,discover
It was then that Mooney * the telegram to Maggie.,sent,albeit,description,bankers

Maggie reached the city that * and Mooney told her what to do.,evening,vehicle,ahead,halfmad
He pointed out that the German lodging-house keeper had already hit upon his identity and the house was being watched_ for he had noticed a window across the street_ back of a barber shop_ that always had the shade * down.,pulled,pipe,bowl,attacking
The window was * from his bed and he could see_ by watching it_ that this shade moved occasionally.,visible,lodginghouse,was,heaven

He knew * well that the German had recognized him and reported the fact to the police.,perfectly,my,send,lighter
He explained it all to Maggie * she came in.,when,formulated,reports,beside

But it was not * doctor that Maggie was after.,a,whisked,green,believe
It was an opportunity to call up the office of the express * in Canada and tell them to ship the bag back to this city.,company,automobile,arc,presumably
If the doctor were in_ she would consult him about Mooney and ask to use his telephone_ and if he were not in she would ask the same privilege_ saying * she would return when the doctor should be at home.,that,correct,frivolities,floating

She left with the servant * to pay for the telephone call and went out.,money,forgotten,burlap,unexpected
It was a very clever device because it did not occur to * detective_ who was keeping her in sight_ that it was worth while to go into the doctor’s office to inquire what she was doing there.,the,covering,bell,snap
What she would * doing there was too obvious.,be,tents,goes,theory
He therefore contented himself with shadowing her back * the lodging house and keeping the place under his eye from the curtained window behind the barber shop.,to,tropical,uniforms,drawer
Maggie remained with the * man that night.,sick,behind,these,clock

A solicitor or some official authority had ventured a doubt about the handwriting on the page beside the last * in the diary.,entry,lantern,cynical,noticed

The persons in Dercum’s expedition_ persons whose integrity could * be doubted_ had been but a few minutes behind him in entering this snow hut in which the Earl of Rexford had been found_ and they had at once_ at Dercum’s direction_ written their signatures at the bottom of the page.,not,compressed,full,trail
