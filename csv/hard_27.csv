Persons who \"back_\" as it is called in racing argot_ successful horses to win them large sums of money_ are generally_ in the exultation of the moment_ very open-handed_ and think it right to give a winning jockey a ten or twenty pound note_ or even a larger sum_ according to the scale of their *.,luck,£15000,something,North

Whether_ therefore_ in the face of such risks_ £1_000 is too little_ or too much_ or just the right sum to be given with a view to secure a rider's honesty_ who shall determine if not the man who is the proprietor of the animal_ and who has very probably backed his horse to win him twenty or thirty thousand pounds?

Race-horses are frequently \"backed\" to win sums of from £1_000 to £100_000.
