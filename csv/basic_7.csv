The book is the Quran_ which the Muhammadans * was dictated by God to Muhammad through the Archangel Gabriel.,think,clear,,claim
It would not be surprising if the Persians_ being Muhammadans_ wished all their boys to learn what they believe to be God’s Word but the book is written in Arabic_ which Persian boys do not understand_ and even the letters are not quite the same as in Persian so when the little pupil reaches the end of the book he can read the Quran with the proper intonation_ but he can read nothing else_ and he cannot understand * Quran.,the,bonfires?,medicine,labour
The Muhammadans_ *_ think that reading the Quran_ quite apart from understanding it_ is a very good action_ so the little Persian boys work away at it_ and they do not think it hard lines because they know all the men_ and big boys began in the same way_ so it seems the natural thing to do.,however,others,please,Giving
