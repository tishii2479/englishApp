This is now accomplished by the publication of his Elements of Chemistry; therefore no excuse can be at all * for giving the following work to the public in an English dress; and the only hesitation of the Translator is with regard to his own abilities for the task.,necessary,o,possession,doing

Mr Lavoisier has added_ in an Appendix_ several very useful Tables for facilitating the calculations now necessary in the advanced state of modern chemistry_ wherein the most scrupulous accuracy * required.,is,adheres,sulphurets,lodged

When I began the following Work_ my only object was to extend and explain more fully the Memoir which I read at the public meeting * the Academy of Sciences in the month of April 1787_ on the necessity of reforming and completing the Nomenclature of Chemistry.,of,cut,evaporatory,acknowledge
While engaged in this employment_ I perceived_ better than I had ever done before_ * justice of the following maxims of the Abbé de Condillac_ in his System of Logic_ and some other of his works.,the,division,fermentable,cause
We think only through the medium * words.,of,best,flying,sulphurous
Thus_ while I thought myself employed only in forming a Nomenclature_ and while I proposed to myself nothing more than to improve the chemical language_ my work transformed * by degrees_ without my being able to prevent it_ into a treatise upon the Elements of Chemistry.,itself,expose,refrigeration,passed
Like three impressions of * same seal_ the word ought to produce the idea_ and the idea to be a picture of the fact.,the,small,nothing,collecting

To those who will consider it with attention_ the first * of this treatise will afford frequent proofs of the truth of the above observations.,part,lymph,cup,pistol
But as_ in the conduct of my work_ I have been obliged to observe an order of arrangement essentially differing from what has been adopted in any other chemical work yet published_ it is proper that I should * the motives which have led me to do so.,explain,decompound,green,painted
It is a maxim universally admitted in geometry_ and indeed in every branch of knowledge_ that_ in the progress of investigation_ we should proceed from * facts to what is unknown.,known,approaching,plate,lemons
In early infancy_ * ideas spring from our wants; the sensation of want excites the idea of the object by which it is to be gratified.,our,buildings,true,successfully
In this manner_ from a series of sensations_ observations_ and analyses_ a successive train of ideas arises_ so linked together_ that an attentive observer may trace back to a certain point the order and connection of the * sum of human knowledge.,whole,theory,introduced,remained
When we begin the study of any science_ we * in a situation_ respecting that science_ similar to that of children; and the course by which we have to advance is precisely the same which Nature follows in the formation of their ideas.,are,expansion,little,ever
In a child_ the idea is merely an effect produced by a sensation; and_ in the same manner_ in commencing the study of a physical science_ we ought to form * idea but what is a necessary consequence_ and immediate effect_ of an experiment or observation.,no,approximation,disquisitions,lured
Besides_ he that enters upon the career of science_ is in a * advantageous situation than a child who is acquiring his first ideas.,less,salt,solder,pigs
To the child_ Nature gives various means of rectifying any mistakes he may commit respecting the salutary or hurtful qualities of the * which surround him.,objects,numerous,kind,variety
On every * his judgments are corrected by experience; want and pain are the necessary consequences arising from false judgment; gratification and pleasure are produced by judging aright.,occasion,top,pestle,effervescence
Under such masters_ we cannot fail to become well *; and we soon learn to reason justly_ when want and pain are the necessary consequences of a contrary conduct.,informed,experimental,committed,settle
In the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the false judgments * form neither affect our existence nor our welfare; and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them.,we,lid,avidity,rendering
Imagination_ on the contrary_ which is ever wandering beyond the bounds of truth_ joined * self-love and that self-confidence we are so apt to indulge_ prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately derived from facts; so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving ourselves.,to,prevalent,advanced,producing
Hence it is by no means to be wondered_ that_ in the science * physics in general_ men have often made suppositions_ instead of forming conclusions.,of,decompose,x,rasps
These suppositions_ handed down from one age to another_ acquire additional weight from the authorities by which they are supported_ till at last they are *_ even by men of genius_ as fundamental truths.,received,l,analytical,recomposition
The only method of preventing such errors from taking place_ and of correcting them when formed_ is to restrain and simplify our reasoning as * as possible.,much,evidences,atmospherical,separates
This depends entirely upon ourselves_ and * neglect of it is the only source of our mistakes.,the,possible,appears,uniting
We must trust to nothing * facts: These are presented to us by Nature_ and cannot deceive.,but,properly,this,balances

It is almost impossible to become a chemist in less * three or four years of constant application.,than,far,insurmountable,fuerit
These inconveniencies are occasioned not so much by the nature of the subject_ as by the method of teaching it; and_ to avoid them_ I was chiefly induced to adopt a new arrangement of chemistry_ which appeared to * more consonant to the order of Nature.,me,excludes,important,five

The notion of four elements_ which_ by the variety of their proportions_ compose all the known substances in nature_ is a mere hypothesis_ assumed long * the first principles of experimental philosophy or of chemistry had any existence.,before,quicksilver,wanted,belonging

The first chemists that wrote after the revival of letters_ considered sulphur and salt as elementary substances entering * the composition of a great number of substances; hence_ instead of four_ they admitted the existence of six elements.,into,treating,alloyage,wine

All that * be said upon the number and nature of elements is_ in my opinion_ confined to discussions entirely of a metaphysical nature.,can,seaside,kingdoms,improve

Guided by the work which_ in the year 1787_ Messrs de Morveau_ Berthollet_ de Fourcroy_ and I composed upon the Nomenclature of Chemistry_ I have *_ as much as possible_ to denominate simple bodies by simple terms_ and I was naturally led to name these first.,endeavoured,mines,guides,soil

We know likewise_ * the experiments of M. Pelletier_ that phosphorus may be combined with a great number of metallic substances.,from,edge,stratum,permanent
These different combinations we have classed under generic names taken from the common substance_ with a termination which marks this analogy_ specifying them by another name taken from that substance which is * to each.,proper,double,resisting,regular
The nomenclature of bodies compounded of three simple substances was attended with still greater difficulty_ not * on account of their number_ but_ particularly_ because we cannot express the nature of their constituent principles without employing more compound names.,only,geting,state,tincture
In the bodies which form this class_ such as the neutral salts_ for instance_ we had to consider_ 1st_ The acidifying principle_ which is common to them all; 2d_ The * principle which constitutes their peculiar acid; 3d_ The saline_ earthy_ or metallic basis_ which determines the particular species of salt.,acidifiable,diminish,creation,remedied

A salt_ though compounded of * same three principles_ may_ nevertheless_ by the mere difference of their proportion_ be in three different states.,the,academic,decompound,bases

Water gives us a regular and constant example of these facts; whilst below Zero of the French thermometer_ * 32° of Fahrenheit_ it remains solid_ and is called ice.,or,burning,herrings,instances
For * reason_ in the memoir which I published in 1777_ I gave it the names of igneous fluid and matter of heat.,this,make,gathered,order
Wherefore_ we have distinguished the cause of heat_ or that exquisitely * fluid which produces it_ by the term of caloric.,elastic,managed,displace,nitrous
In * present state of our knowledge_ we are unable to determine whether light be a modification of caloric_ or if caloric be_ on the contrary_ a modification of light.,the,artist,oxydating,lengthen
We * distinguish light from caloric; though we do not therefore deny that these have certain qualities in common_ and that_ in certain circumstances_ they combine with other bodies almost in the same manner_ and produce_ in part_ the same effects.,therefore,argill,necks,invented
What I have already said may suffice to determine the idea * to the word caloric; but there remains a more difficult attempt_ which is_ to give a just conception of the manner in which caloric acts upon other bodies.,affixed,elegant,altogether,besides
It * in these things which we neither see nor feel_ that it is especially necessary to guard against the extravagancy of our imagination_ which forever inclines to step beyond the bounds of truth_ and is very difficultly restrained within the narrow line of facts.,is,gases,r,furnaces
But_ if these two powers only existed_ bodies would become liquid at an indivisible degree of the thermometer_ and would almost instantaneously pass from the solid state of aggregation * that of aëriform elasticity.,to,extraordinary,lifeless,laddle
Thus water_ for instance_ at the very moment when it ceases * be ice_ would begin to boil_ and would be transformed into an aëriform fluid_ having its particles scattered indefinitely through the surrounding space.,to,subjoined,mathematical,consequence

Whence it appears that_ without this atmospheric pressure_ we * not have any permanent liquid_ and should only be able to see bodies in that state of existence in the very instant of melting_ as the smallest additional caloric would instantly separate their particles_ and dissipate them through the surrounding medium.,should,united,engrave,intelligent
Simple reflection upon the most common * is sufficient to evince the truth of these positions.,experiments,sunk,variations,doubts
They are more particularly proved by * following experiment_ which I published in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1777_ p.,the,scrupulous,continue,provided
Having filled with sulphuric ether a small * glass vessel_ A_ (Plate VII. Fig.,narrow,kingdom,inspecting,flattened
The vessel should be filled in such a manner with * ether_ as not to leave the smallest portion of air between the liquor and the bladder.,the,impressions,alterations,transported
Immediately the ether begins to boil with great violence_ and * changed into an elastic aëriform fluid_ which fills the receiver.,is,barrels,enlarged,compound
If the quantity of ether be sufficient to leave * few drops in the phial after the evaporation is finished_ the elastic fluid produced will sustain the mercury in the barometer attached to the air-pump_ at eight or ten inches in winter_ and from twenty to twenty-five in summer.,a,measures,consonant,f
To render this experiment more complete_ we may introduce a small * into the phial A_ containing the ether_ which will descend considerably during the evaporation.,thermometer,igneous,wish,yield
There is therefore * fluid evaporated from alkohol than from ether_ less from water than from alkohol_ and still less from mercury than from either; consequently there is less caloric employed_ and less cold produced_ which quadrates exactly with the results of these experiments.,less,invented,lengthened,nomenclature
Another species * experiment proves very evidently that the aëriform state is a modification of bodies dependent on the degree of temperature_ and on the pressure which these bodies undergo.,of,dirty,mouths,dryness

And_ lastly_ the temperature of the blood being nearly that at which ether passes from the * to the aëriform state_ it must evaporate in the primae viae_ and consequently it is very probable the medical properties of this fluid depend chiefly upon its mechanical effect.,liquid,property,passing,marbles
These experiments succeed better with nitrous ether_ because it * in a lower temperature than sulphuric ether.,evaporates,excessively,premised,interpose
It is more difficult to obtain alkohol in the aëriform state; because_ as it requires 67° (182.75°) to reduce it to vapour_ the water of the bath must be almost boiling_ and consequently it is impossible to * the hands into it at that temperature.,plunge,whereby,dissengaged,formally
It is evident that_ if water were used in the foregoing experiment_ it would be changed into gas_ when exposed to a temperature superior to that * which it boils.,at,hydrostatic,list,stream
Although thoroughly convinced of this_ Mr de la Place and myself judged it necessary to * it by the following direct experiment.,confirm,subdivisions,probably,deflagrations
We filled a glass * A_ (Plate VII. Fig.,jar,desiderata,stand,undersaturated
Immediately after withdrawing the apparatus from the boiler_ the vapour in the jar began * condense_ and the mercury rose to its former station; but it returned again to the aëriform state a few seconds after replacing the apparatus in the boiler.,to,period,stirred,phials
We have thus a certain number of *_ which are convertible into elastic aëriform fluids by degrees of temperature_ not much superior to that of our atmosphere.,substances,below,professors,flattened
We shall afterwards find that there are several others which undergo the same change in similar circumstances_ such as muriatic * marine acid_ ammoniac or volatile alkali_ the carbonic acid or fixed air_ the sulphurous acid_ &c.,or,sufficiently,uniformly,weights
All of these are permanently elastic in or about the mean temperature of the atmosphere_ and under its * pressure.,common,adjectives,extend,an
Henceforwards I shall express these elastic aëriform fluids by the generic term gas; and in each species of gas I shall distinguish between the caloric_ which in some measure serves the purpose of a solvent_ and the substance_ which in combination with the caloric_ * the base of the gas.,forms,terminations,generic,part

We have already shown_ that the particles of every substance in nature * in a certain state of equilibrium_ between that attraction which tends to unite and keep the particles together_ and the effects of the caloric which tends to separate them.,exist,rubbish,obstacle,taper
Hence the caloric not only surrounds the particles * all bodies on every side_ but fills up every interval which the particles of bodies leave between each other.,of,supposing,perfected,ferment
We may form an idea of this_ by * a vessel filled with small spherical leaden bullets_ into which a quantity of fine sand is poured_ which_ insinuating into the intervals between the bullets_ will fill up every void.,supposing,converting,stone,repulsive
If_ instead of spherical balls_ we substitute solid * of a hexahedral_ octohedral_ or any other regular figure_ the capacity of the intervals between them will be lessened_ and consequently will no longer contain the same quantity of sand.,bodies,exhibits,given,empyreal
In this manner we must understand the following expression_ introduced * the English philosophers_ who have given us the first precise ideas upon this subject; the capacity of bodies for containing the matter of heat.,by,dispense,spiritous,creation
As comparisons with sensible objects are of great use in assisting us to form distinct notions of abstract ideas_ * shall endeavour to illustrate this_ by instancing the phenomena which take place between water and bodies which are wetted and penetrated by it_ with a few reflections.,we,much,incapable,comes

Free caloric_ is that which is not combined in any * with any other body.,manner,suspicion,bones,buildings
But_ as we live in a system to which caloric has a very strong adhesion_ * follows that we are never able to obtain it in the state of absolute freedom.,it,extending,compared,agriculture
Combined *_ is that which is fixed in bodies by affinity or elective attraction_ so as to form part of the substance of the body_ even part of its solidity.,caloric,fractions,rammed,quod
By the expression specific * of bodies_ we understand the respective quantities of caloric requisite for raising a number of bodies of the same weight to an equal degree of temperature.,caloric,shown,susceptible,mostly
This proportional quantity of caloric depends upon * distance between the constituent particles of bodies_ and their greater or lesser degrees of cohesion; and this distance_ or rather the space or void resulting from it_ is_ as I have already observed_ called the capacity of bodies for containing caloric.,the,conformable,spiked,steam
Heat_ considered as a *_ or_ in other words_ sensible heat_ is only the effect produced upon our sentient organs_ by the motion or passage of caloric_ disengaged from the surrounding bodies.,sensation,urged,waiting,lay
In general_ we receive impressions * in consequence of motion_ and we might establish it as an axiom_ That_ .,only,indulge,boils,prius
This general principle applies very accurately to the sensations of heat and cold: When we touch a cold body_ the caloric which always tends to become in equilibrio in all bodies_ passes * our hand into the body we touch_ which gives us the feeling or sensation of cold.,from,engraver,remains,fitting
The direct contrary happens_ when we touch * warm body_ the caloric then passing from the body into our hand_ produces the sensation of heat.,a,phosphoric,matras,rigorously
If the hand and the body touched be of the same temperature_ or very nearly so_ we receive no impression_ either of heat or cold_ because there is no motion or passage of caloric; and thus no sensation can take *_ without some correspondent motion to occasion it.,place,copper,cover,recipients
When the thermometer rises_ it shows_ that free caloric is entering into the surrounding bodies: The thermometer_ which is one of *_ receives its share in proportion to its mass_ and to the capacity which it possesses for containing caloric.,these,parenthetical,float,structure
The change therefore which takes place upon the thermometer_ only announces a change of place of the caloric in those bodies_ of which the thermometer forms one part; it only * the portion of caloric received_ without being a measure of the whole quantity disengaged_ displaced_ or absorbed.,indicates,firework,examples,unfortunately
The most simple and most exact method for determining this latter point_ is that described by Mr de * Place_ in the Memoirs of the Academy_ No.,la,contained,elastic,finds
This method consists in placing a body_ or a combination of bodies_ from which caloric is disengaging_ in the midst of a hollow sphere of ice; and the quantity of ice melted becomes an * measure of the quantity of caloric disengaged.,exact,iris,collection,solubility
It is possible_ by means of the apparatus which we have caused to be constructed upon this plan_ to *_ not as has been pretended_ the capacity of bodies for containing heat_ but the ratio of the increase or diminution of capacity produced by determinate degrees of temperature.,determine,portable,every,mountain
Perhaps_ when experiments have been made * sufficient accuracy_ we may one day be able to determine the proportional quantity of caloric_ necessary for producing the several species of gasses.,with,possessing,suffice,concomitant
I shall hereafter_ in a separate chapter_ give an account of the principal results of * experiments as have been made upon this head.,such,save,sugar,dangerous
It remains_ before finishing this article_ to say a few words relative to the cause of the * of gasses_ and of fluids in the state of vapour.,elasticity,six,perfect,aërated
It is by no means difficult to perceive * this elasticity depends upon that of caloric_ which seems to be the most eminently elastic body in nature.,that,my,c,fruits
Nothing is more readily conceived_ than that one body * become elastic by entering into combination with another body possessed of that quality.,should,sulphureous,lastly,experiment
We must allow that this is only an explanation of elasticity_ by an assumption of elasticity_ and that we thus only remove the difficulty * step farther_ and that the nature of elasticity_ and the reason for caloric being elastic_ remains still unexplained.,one,minutes,sunt,whereof
Elasticity in the abstract * nothing more than that quality of the particles of bodies by which they recede from each other when forced together.,is,pounded,liquids,talking
This tendency in * particles of caloric to separate_ takes place even at considerable distances.,the,meteors,nicer,weaker
We shall be satisfied of this_ when we consider that air is susceptible of undergoing great compression_ which supposes that its particles were previously very distant from each other; for the power of approaching together certainly supposes a previous distance_ * least equal to the degree of approach.,at,proof,cristallization,expressing
Consequently_ those particles of the air_ which are * considerably distant from each other_ tend to separate still farther.,already,very,criticised,medical
Here_ therefore_ exists a * repulsion between the particles of elastic fluids; at least_ circumstances take place exactly as if such a repulsion actually existed; and we have very good right to conclude_ that the particles of caloric mutually repel each other.,true,logarithmical,accelerates,carbonic
We have somewhat analogous to this idea in the phenomena which occur when a dry sponge is dipt into water: The sponge swells; its particles separate from each other; * all its intervals are filled up by the water.,and,like,changing,permanent
It is evident_ that the sponge_ in the act of swelling_ has acquired a greater capacity for * water than it had when dry.,containing,chain,benzoic,distinctions

These views which I have taken of the formation of elastic aëriform fluids or gasses_ throw great light upon the original formation of the atmospheres of the planets_ and particularly * of our earth.,that,deduce,employed,less
The better to determine our ideas relating to this subject_ which has not hitherto been sufficiently *_ let us_ for a moment_ conceive what change would take place in the various substances which compose our earth_ if its temperature were suddenly altered.,considered,strictly,waters,point

Modern chemistry has made great * in this research; and it will appear by the following details that the analysis of atmospherical air has been more rigorously determined than that of any other substance of the class.,advances,boil,aqua,clears

As Mr Ingenhouz has neither examined the change produced on iron_ nor upon the air by this operation_ I have repeated the experiment under different circumstances_ in * apparatus adapted to answer my particular views_ as follows.,an,ago,decomposes,deposition
I then provided a small capsule of china-ware D_ very flat and open_ in which I placed some small pieces of iron_ turned spirally_ and arranged in such a way as seemed most favourable for the combustion being communicated to * part.,every,black,dark,picture
To * end of one of these pieces of iron was fixed a small morsel of tinder_ to which was added about the sixteenth part of a grain of phosphorus_ and_ by raising the bell-glass a little_ the china capsule_ with its contents_ were introduced into the pure air.,the,abridgment,fifty,borrowing
I know that_ by this means_ some common air must mix with the pure air in the glass; but this_ when it is done *_ is so very trifling_ as not to injure the success of the experiment.,dexterously,sorrel,times,observer
This being done_ a part of the air is * out from the bell-glass_ by means of a syphon GHI_ so as to raise the mercury within the glass to EF; and_ to prevent the mercury from getting into the syphon_ a small piece of paper is twisted round its extremity.,sucked,perceiving,element,circumstance

I shall_ in the sequel_ give an account of these methods of analysing air_ when I have explained the nature of these different substances_ which are only here in a * accidentally mentioned.,manner,sides,now,adhesion
I mentioned before_ that we have two ways of determining the constituent parts of atmospheric air_ the method of *_ and that by synthesis.,analysis,absolutely,longer,despaired

But we can equally accomplish * synthetic composition of atmospheric air_ by borrowing the materials of which it is composed from different kingdoms of nature.,this,decomposed,young,filed

And_ if we take 73 parts_ by weight_ * this elastic fluid_ and mix it with 27 parts of highly respirable air_ procured from calcined mercury_ we will form an elastic fluid precisely similar to atmospheric air in all its properties.,of,affected,coarse,animals
There are many other methods of separating * respirable from the noxious part of the atmospheric air_ which cannot be taken notice of in this part_ without anticipating information_ which properly belongs to the subsequent chapters.,the,pearlwhite,depends,makers
The experiments already adduced may suffice for an elementary treatise; and_ in matters of this nature_ the * of our evidences is of far greater consequence than their number.,choice,unhealthy,n,successive
I shall close this article_ by pointing out the property which atmospheric air_ and all the known gasses_ possess of dissolving water_ which is of great * to be attended to in all experiments of this nature.,consequence,γεινομας,perceived,accompanies
Mr Saussure found_ by experiment_ that a cubical foot of atmospheric air is capable of holding 12 grains of water in solution: Other gasses_ as the carbonic acid_ appear capable of dissolving a greater quantity; but experiments are still wanting by * to determine their several proportions.,which,island,fish,prius
This water_ held in solution by gasses_ gives rise to particular phenomena in many experiments_ which require great attention_ * which has frequently proved the source of great errors to chemists in determining the results of their experiments.,and,buildings,change,decline
It will likewise be necessary to take care that the air contained in the glass_ both before and * the experiment_ be reduced to a common temperature and pressure_ otherwise the results of the following calculations will be fallacious.,after,lixiviations,discuss,obscured
Hitherto I have been obliged * make use of circumlocution_ to express the nature of the several substances which constitute our atmosphere_ having provisionally used the terms of respirable and noxious_ or non-respirable parts of the air.,to,submit,sulphite,prius
But the investigations I mean to undertake require a more direct mode of expression; and_ having now endeavoured to give simple and distinct ideas of the different * which enter into the composition of the atmosphere_ I shall henceforth express these ideas by words equally simple.,substances,cloth,carried,balance
As this phenomenon has not been generally observed_ no language has used a particular term for expressing water in this state; and the same thing occurs with all fluids_ and all substances_ which do not evaporate in the common temperature_ and * the usual pressure of our atmosphere.,under,largest,evaporatory,half
New words have been drawn_ chiefly from the Greek language_ in such a manner * to make their etymology convey some idea of what was meant to be represented; and these we have always endeavoured to make short_ and of such a nature as to be changeable into adjectives and verbs.,as,directly,on,were
Following these principles_ we have_ after Mr Macquer's example_ retained the term gas_ employed by Vanhelmont_ having arranged the numerous class * elastic aëriform fluids under that name_ excepting only atmospheric air.,of,gather,gentleman,multiply
Gas_ therefore_ in our nomenclature_ becomes a generic term_ expressing the fullest degree of saturation in * body with caloric; being_ in fact_ a term expressive of a mode of existence.,any,prevent,character,slight
To distinguish each species of gas_ we employ a second term from the name of the base_ which_ saturated with caloric_ * each particular gas.,forms,higher,filtre,perceive
We have given to the base of the former_ or * portion of the air_ the name of oxygen_ from οξυς acidum_ and γεινομας_ gignor; because_ in reality_ one of the most general properties of this base is to form acids_ by combining with many different substances.,respirable,edge,exactly,phenomena

We have preserved that term for this acid from sulphur under-saturated with oxygen; and distinguish the other_ or completely * or oxygenated acid_ by the name of sulphuric acid.,saturated,familiar,supports,verified
We shall adopt * difference of termination for all the acids which assume several degrees of saturation.,this,yeast,rank,perceived
Hence we have a phosphorous and a phosphoric acid_ an acetous and an acetic acid; and * on_ for others in similar circumstances.,so,oxydation,compared,salutary
This part of chemical science would have been extremely simple_ * the nomenclature of the acids would not have been at all perplexed_ as it is now in the old nomenclature_ if the base or radical of each acid had been known when the acid itself was discovered.,and,unacquainted,describing,gignor
Thus_ for instance_ phosphorus being a known substance before the discovery of its acid_ this latter was rightly distinguished by a term drawn from the name of its * base.,acidifiable,motives,subsists,close
The same thing happened with the * acid formerly called fixed air; it not being known that this acid was the result of combining charcoal with oxygen_ a variety of denominations have been given to it_ not one of which conveys just ideas of its nature or origin.,aëriform,proportional,indicate,rank
To disengage this * from the alkaline base with which it is combined_ we have only to pour sulphuric acid upon sea-salt_ immediately a brisk effervescence takes place_ white vapours arise_ of a very penetrating odour_ and_ by only gently heating the mixture_ all the acid is driven off.,acid,knows,receiving,combinations
As_ in the common temperature and pressure of our *_ this acid is naturally in the state of gas_ we must use particular precautions for retaining it in proper vessels.,atmosphere,admitted,add,section
For * experiments_ the most simple and most commodious apparatus consists of a small retort G_ (Pl.,small,entire,translate,truly
In proportion as the acid gas is disengaged_ it passes * the jar_ and gets to the top of the quicksilver_ which it displaces.,into,require,contained,exceeds

This latter circumstance is taken advantage of in laboratories and manufactures_ on purpose to obtain the acid of sea-salt in a liquid form; and for this purpose the * (Pl.,apparatus,familiar,corrected,perform
This apparatus will be more * described in the latter part of this work.,amply,cylindrical,say,accompanied
Although we have not yet been able_ either to compose or to * this acid of sea-salt_ we cannot have the smallest doubt that it_ like all other acids_ is composed by the union of oxygen with an acidifiable base.,decompound,stated,rivalled,choosing
We have therefore called this unknown substance the muriatic base_ or muriatic radical_ deriving this name_ after the example of Mr Bergman and Mr * Morveau_ from the Latin word muria_ which was anciently used to signify sea-salt.,de,retorts,four,bulk
If ever this acidifiable base of the muriatic acid is discovered to be a known substance_ though now unknown in that capacity_ it will be requisite to change its present denomination for * analogous with that of its base.,one,what,finish,degrees
In common with sulphuric acid_ and several other acids_ the muriatic is capable of different degrees of *; but the excess of oxygen produces quite contrary effects upon it from what the same circumstance produces upon the acid of sulphur.,oxygenation,precautions,susceptibility,bubbles
With muriatic acid_ the direct reverse takes place; an additional saturation with oxygen renders it more volatile_ of a more penetrating odour_ less miscible with *_ and diminishes its acid properties.,water,enable,consuming,unfit
Although the base or radical of the acid which is extracted from nitre or saltpetre be better known_ we have judged proper * to modify its name in the same manner with that of the muriatic acid.,only,repeating,calls,doubts
It is drawn from nitre_ * the intervention of sulphuric acid_ by a process similar to that described for extracting the muriatic acid_ and by means of the same apparatus (Pl.,by,due,gather,gray
In proportion as the acid passes over_ it * in part condensed in the baloon or recipient_ and the rest is absorbed by the water contained in the bottles L_L_L_L; the water becomes first green_ then blue_ and at last yellow_ in proportion to the concentration of the acid.,is,watery,explanatory,recovering
During this operation_ a large quantity of oxygen gas_ mixed with a small proportion of * gas_ is disengaged.,azotic,unfortunately,if,corrected
This acid_ like all others_ is composed of oxygen_ united to an acidifiable base_ and is even the first * in which the existence of oxygen was well ascertained.,acid,dispense,complicated,expected
Its two constituent elements are but weakly united_ and are easily separated_ by presenting any substance * which oxygen has a stronger affinity than with the acidifiable base peculiar to this acid.,with,secondary,ovens,gratification
By some experiments of this kind_ it was first discovered that azote_ or the base of mephitis or azotic gas_ constituted its acidifiable base or radical; and consequently that the * of nitre was really an azotic acid_ having azote for its base_ combined with oxygen.,acid,undersaturated,conclusions,dimensions
For these reasons_ that we might be consistent with our principles_ it appeared necessary_ either to call the acid by the name of azotic_ or to name the base nitric *; but from either of these we were dissuaded_ by the following considerations.,radical,ratio,pharmacy,ventured
The acid of nitre is susceptible of assuming a great number of separate states_ depending upon its degree of oxygenation_ or upon the proportions in which azote and oxygen * into its composition.,enter,who,rest,cited
By a first or lowest degree of oxygenation_ it forms a particular species of gas_ which we * continue to name nitrous gas; this is composed nearly of two parts_ by weight_ of oxygen combined with one part of azote; and in this state it is not miscible with water.,shall,completing,expressing,suspected
In * gas_ the azote is by no means saturated with oxygen_ but_ on the contrary_ has still a very great affinity for that element_ and even attracts it from atmospheric air_ immediately upon getting into contact with it.,this,bellows,baked,tungstat
This combination of nitrous gas with atmospheric * has even become one of the methods for determining the quantity of oxygen contained in air_ and consequently for ascertaining its degree of salubrity.,air,vigour,barometers,sharpness
This addition of oxygen converts the nitrous gas into a powerful acid_ which has a strong affinity with *_ and which is itself susceptible of various additional degrees of oxygenation.,water,phials,error,seaside
When the proportions of oxygen and azote is below * parts_ by weight_ of the former_ to one of the latter_ the acid is red coloured_ and emits copious fumes.,three,occur,cheap,isinglass
In this state_ by the application of a gentle heat_ it gives out nitrous gas; and we * it_ in this degree of oxygenation_ nitrous acid.,term,crystal,jar,acetites
When four parts_ by weight_ of oxygen_ are combined with one part of azote_ the acid is clear and colourless_ more fixed in the fire than the nitrous acid_ has less *_ and its constituent elements are more firmly united.,odour,matter,eminently,o
This species * acid_ in conformity with our principles of nomenclature_ is called nitric acid.,of,dry,notches,compression
Thus_ nitric acid is the acid * nitre_ surcharged with oxygen; nitrous acid is the acid of nitre surcharged with azote; or_ what is the same thing_ with nitrous gas; and this latter is azote not sufficiently saturated with oxygen to possess the properties of an acid.,of,only,motion,producible
To this degree * oxygenation_ we have afterwards_ in the course of this work_ given the generical name of oxyd.,of,works,propose,cows
The term formerly used by the English chemists for this acid was written sulphureous; but * have thought proper to spell it as above_ that it may better conform with the similar terminations of nitrous_ carbonous_ &c.,we,practice,acidity,allowed
In general_ we have used the English terminations ic and ous to translate the terms of the Author which * with ique and cux_ with hardly any other alterations.,end,sum,glasshouses,exact
For this *_ the operation called decrepitation is used_ which consists in subjecting it to nearly a red heat_ in a proper vessel_ so as to evaporate all its water of crystallization.,purpose,have,ways,myself
Oxygen has a stronger affinity with metals heated to a * degree than with caloric; in consequence of which_ all metallic bodies_ excepting gold_ silver_ and platina_ have the property of decomposing oxygen gas_ by attracting its base from the caloric with which it was combined.,certain,cavity,finest,correct
We * already shown in what manner this decomposition takes place_ by means of mercury and iron; having observed_ that_ in the case of the first_ it must be considered as a kind of gradual combustion_ whilst_ in the latter_ the combustion is extremely rapid_ and attended with a brilliant flame.,have,suppositions,clearly,hottest
The use of the heat employed in * operations is to separate the particles of the metal from each other_ and to diminish their attraction of cohesion or aggregation_ or_ what is the same thing_ their mutual attraction for each other.,these,solidly,acknowledgment,garnet
The absolute weight of metallic substances is augmented in proportion to the quantity of oxygen * absorb; they_ at the same time_ lose their metallic splendour_ and are reduced into an earthy pulverulent matter.,they,judgment,evaporating,superabundant
In this * metals must not be considered as entirely saturated with oxygen_ because their action upon this element is counterbalanced by the power of affinity between it and caloric.,state,transported,additions,center
Wherefore_ when metallic substances are oxygenated * atmospheric air_ or in oxygen gas_ they are not converted into acids like sulphur_ phosphorus_ and charcoal_ but are only changed into intermediate substances_ which_ though approaching to the nature of salts_ have not acquired all the saline properties.,in,absurd,wood,revives
The old chemists have affixed the name of calx not only to metals in this state_ but to every body * has been long exposed to the action of fire without being melted.,which,unable,expressive,follows
This mode of classifying * of so very opposite natures_ under the same generic name_ would have been quite contrary to our principles of nomenclature_ especially as_ by retaining the above term for this state of metallic substances_ we must have conveyed very false ideas of its nature.,substances,wax,fermentable,cruciferous
We have_ therefore_ laid aside the expression metallic calx altogether_ and have substituted in its place the term oxyd_ * the Greek word οξυς.,from,equilibrio,system,probability
By this * be seen_ that the language we have adopted is both copious and expressive.,may,amongst,hyacinth,arises
We have not confined the term * to expressing the combinations of metals with oxygen_ but have extended it to signify that first degree of oxygenation in all bodies_ which_ without converting them into acids_ causes them to approach to the nature of salts.,oxyd,for,spherical,sandbath
Thus_ we give the name of oxyd of sulphur to that soft substance into which sulphur is * by incipient combustion; and we call the yellow matter left by phosphorus_ after combustion_ by the name of oxyd of phosphorus.,converted,setting,day,displaced
In the same manner_ nitrous *_ which is azote in its first degree of oxygenation_ is the oxyd of azote.,gas,submitted,alkali,vessel
We have likewise oxyds in great numbers from * vegetable and animal kingdoms; and I shall show_ in the sequel_ that this new language throws great light upon all the operations of art and nature.,the,brownish,hesitation,enabled
We have already observed_ that almost all the metallic * have peculiar and permanent colours.,oxyds,left,solids,united
These vary not only in the different species of metals_ * even according to the various degrees of oxygenation in the same metal.,but,while,composition,arises
Hence we are under the necessity of adding two epithets to each oxyd_ * of which indicates the metal oxydated_ while the other indicates the peculiar colour of the oxyd.,one,fiery,accompanied,insect
Thus_ * have the black oxyd of iron_ the red oxyd of iron_ and the yellow oxyd of iron; which expressions respectively answer to the old unmeaning terms of martial ethiops_ colcothar_ and rust of iron_ or ochre.,we,included,chalky,oxydations
We have likewise the gray_ yellow_ * red oxyds of lead_ which answer to the equally false or insignificant terms_ ashes of lead_ massicot_ and minium.,and,pin,committed,close
These denominations sometimes become rather long_ especially when * mean to indicate whether the metal has been oxydated in the air_ by detonation with nitre_ or by means of acids; but then they always convey just and accurate ideas of the corresponding object which we wish to express by their use.,we,cylindrical,fail,hydrogen
All this will be rendered perfectly * and distinct by means of the tables which are added to this work.,clear,reverberate,dilation,day

These denominations are extended to all the combinations into which the above three substances *_ without being previously oxygenated.,enter,flakes,aluminous,acidulous

In the state of gas_ it dissolves charcoal_ sulphur_ phosphorus_ and several metals; we distinguish these combinations by the terms_ carbonated * gas_ sulphurated hydrogen gas_ and phosphorated hydrogen gas.,hydrogen,sink,hydrostatic,inhabited

It is the province of the advocates for * system to prove_ by decisive experiments_ the real existence of this combined hydrogen_ which they have hitherto only done by conjectures founded upon suppositions.,this,acquiring,fuerit,closeness
This term alloy_ which we have from the language of the arts_ serves exceedingly well for distinguishing all the combinations or intimate unions of metals with each other_ and is adopted in our new nomenclature for * purpose.,that,crooked,rigorous,business

It remains_ in this chapter_ to treat of the oxygenation of these compound combustible substances_ and to show that there * acids and oxyds having double and triple bases.,exist,wish,hundredth,descends
Nature furnishes us with numerous examples of this kind of combinations_ by means of which_ chiefly_ she is enabled * produce a vast variety of compounds from a very limited number of elements_ or simple substances.,to,foregoing,although,hath
It was long ago well known_ that_ when muriatic * nitric acids were mixed together_ a compound acid was formed_ having properties quite distinct from those of either of the acids taken separately.,and,press,potash,answers
This acid was called aqua regia_ from its most celebrated property of dissolving gold_ called king of metals by * alchymists.,the,plate,cooling,purely
This * of a double base in one acid_ which had formerly been observed only in the nitro-muriatic acid_ occurs continually in the vegetable kingdom_ in which a simple acid_ or one possessed of a single acidifiable base_ is very rarely found.,phenomenon,flannel,urged,schistus
Almost all the acids procurable from this kingdom have bases composed of charcoal and hydrogen_ * of charcoal_ hydrogen_ and phosphorus_ combined with more or less oxygen.,or,compounded,upper,along
All * bases_ whether double or triple_ are likewise formed into oxyds_ having less oxygen than is necessary to give them the properties of acids.,these,appearing,desirous,mother
The acids and oxyds from the animal kingdom are still more *_ as their bases generally consist of a combination of charcoal_ phosphorus_ hydrogen_ and azote.,compound,distributed,diamond,merely
As it is but of late that I have acquired any clear and distinct notions of these substances_ I shall not_ in this place_ enlarge much upon * subject_ which I mean to treat of very fully in some memoirs I am preparing to lay before the Academy.,the,winter,arsenical,insoluble
Sugar_ mucus_ under which term we include the different kinds of gums_ and starch_ are vegetable oxyds_ having hydrogen and charcoal combined_ in different proportions_ as their radicals or bases_ and united with oxygen_ * as to bring them to the state of oxyds.,so,wax,explosions,waters
From the state * oxyds they are capable of being changed into acids by the addition of a fresh quantity of oxygen; and_ according to the degrees of oxygenation_ and the proportion of hydrogen and charcoal in their bases_ they form the several kinds of vegetable acids.,of,live,essays,boiled
Upon that plan_ and * varying the terminations according to the formerly established rules of our nomenclature_ we have the following denominations: Hydro-carbonous_ hydro-carbonic; carbono-hydrous_ and carbono-hydric oxyds.,by,operated,calculation,deceived
And for the acids: Hydro-carbonous_ hydro carbonic_ oxygenated hydro-carbonic; carbono-hydrous_ carbono-hydric_ * oxygenated carbono-hydric.,and,oxygenated,subtractive,which
It is probable that the above terms would suffice for indicating all the varieties in nature_ and that_ in proportion as the vegetable acids become well understood_ they will naturally arrange themselves * these denominations.,under,contain,call,well
But_ though we know the elements of which these are composed_ we are as yet ignorant of the proportions of these ingredients_ and are still far from being able to class them in the above methodical manner; wherefore_ we * determined to retain the ancient names provisionally.,have,atmosphere,along,difficultly
I am still more forcibly necessitated to follow the same plan * naming the acids_ which have three or four elements combined in their bases; of these we have a considerable number from the animal kingdom_ and some even from vegetable substances.,in,details,connect,disquisitions
Azote_ for instance_ joined to hydrogen and charcoal_ form the base or radical of the Prussic acid; we have * to believe that the same happens with the base of the Gallic acid; and almost all the animal acids have their bases composed of azote_ phosphorus_ hydrogen_ and charcoal.,reason,obstinately,widemouthed,premise
Besides_ this part of chemistry being still far from that accuracy it must arrive to_ * perfection of the science ought certainly to precede that of its language; and we must still_ for some time_ retain the old names for the animal oxyds and acids.,the,consisting,indicating,decompound
We have only ventured * make a few slight modifications of these names_ by changing the termination into ous_ when we have reason to suppose the base to be in excess_ and into ic_ when we suspect the oxygen predominates.,to,brightness,delicacy,running
Though all these acids_ as has been already said_ are chiefly_ and almost entirely_ composed of hydrogen_ charcoal_ and oxygen_ yet_ properly speaking_ they contain neither water carbonic acid * oil_ but only the elements necessary for forming these substances.,nor,pores,eyes,brandy
I mean to explain this subject * farther in the succeeding chapter.,somewhat,attractable,maxims,choice
The oxyds of the animal * are hitherto less known than those from the vegetable kingdom_ and their number is as yet not at all determined.,kingdom,retarded,level,tough
The red part of the blood_ lymph_ and most of the secretions_ are true oxyds_ under which point of view * is very important to consider them.,it,descriptions,otherwise,discovery
We are only acquainted with six animal acids_ several of which_ it is probable_ approach very near each other in * nature_ or_ at least_ differ only in a scarcely sensible degree.,their,used,pressed,anticipating
I * not include the phosphoric acid amongst these_ because it is found in all the kingdoms of nature.,do,operation,call,reputation
The connection between the constituent elements of the animal oxyds and acids is not more permanent than in those * the vegetable kingdom_ as a small increase of temperature is sufficient to overturn it.,from,h,premise,tall
I hope to render this * more distinct than has been done hitherto in the following chapter.,subject,twentieth,clays,spars
Of these elements_ hydrogen and oxygen have a strong tendency to unite with caloric_ and be converted into gas_ whilst charcoal is a fixed element_ * but little affinity with caloric.,having,flavour,fat,depend
On the other hand_ oxygen_ which_ in the usual temperature_ * nearly equally to unite with hydrogen and with charcoal_ has a much stronger affinity with charcoal when at the red heat_ and then unites with it to form carbonic acid.,tends,impregnated,overcome,slighted
The hydrogen is * combined with the oxygen nor with the charcoal_ and reciprocally; the particles of these three substances form a triple combination_ which remains in equilibrium whilst undisturbed by caloric but a very slight increase of temperature is sufficient to overturn this structure of combination.,neither,pounded,mephitis,malic
In this high temperature_ either no oil is formed_ or_ if any * produced during the lower temperature at the beginning of the experiment_ it is decomposed by the action of the red heat.,was,buildings,flakes,azotic
Thus the decomposition of vegetable matter_ under a high temperature_ is produced by the action of double and triple affinities; while the charcoal attracts the oxygen_ on purpose to form carbonic acid_ the caloric attracts the hydrogen_ and converts * into hydrogen gas.,it,expansive,about,suspected
The distillation of every species of vegetable substance confirms the truth of this theory_ if we can give that name to * simple relation of facts.,a,producing,cristalized,caused
Animal substances_ being composed nearly of the same elements with cruciferous plants_ give the same products in distillation_ with this difference_ that_ as they contain a greater * of hydrogen and azote_ they produce more oil and more ammoniac.,quantity,for,languid,advocates
I shall only produce one fact as a proof of the exactness * which this theory explains all the phenomena which occur during the distillation of animal substances_ which is the rectification and total decomposition of volatile animal oil_ commonly known by the name of Dippel's oil.,with,saturated,cyder,twisted
When these oils are * by a first distillation in a naked fire they are brown_ from containing a little charcoal almost in a free state; but they become quite colourless by rectification.,procured,economical,beak,etymology
Even in this state * charcoal in their composition has so slight a connection with the other elements as to separate by mere exposure to the air.,the,adhesion,base,forty
Hence the only way of preserving these oils colourless and transparent_ is by * them in bottles perfectly full and accurately corked_ to hinder the contact of air_ which always discolours them.,keeping,fatty,receiving,sensible
Successive rectifications of * oil furnish another phenomenon confirming our theory.,this,fluor,announces,forcibly
In each distillation a small quantity * charcoal remains in the retort_ and a little water is formed by the union of the oxygen contained in the air of the distilling vessels with the hydrogen of the oil.,of,earths,streached,pastes
As this takes place in * successive distillation_ if we make use of large vessels and a considerable degree of heat_ we at last decompose the whole of the oil_ and change it entirely into water and charcoal.,each,meeting,kept,included
When we use small vessels_ and especially when we employ a slow fire_ or degree * heat little above that of boiling water_ the total decomposition of these oils_ by repeated distillation_ is greatly more tedious_ and more difficultly accomplished.,of,advise,analyses,extracting

A rapid intestine motion_ or fermentation_ very soon takes place_ numerous globules of gas form in the liquid and burst at the surface; when the fermentation is at its height_ the quantity of gas disengaged is so * as to make the liquor appear as if boiling violently over a fire.,great,surmounted,data,eighth
When this gas is carefully gathered_ * is found to be carbonic acid perfectly pure_ and free from admixture with any other species of air or gas whatever.,it,gazometers,modification,melts
When the fermentation is completed_ the juice of grapes is changed from being sweet_ and full of sugar_ into a vinous liquor which no longer contains any sugar_ and from which we *_ by distillation_ an inflammable liquor_ known in commerce under the name of Spirit of Wine.,procure,satisfactory,altering,hesitation
This operation is one of the most extraordinary in chemistry: We must examine whence proceed the disengaged carbonic acid and the inflammable liquor produced_ and in what manner a sweet vegetable oxyd becomes thus converted into two * opposite substances_ whereof one is combustible_ and the other eminently the contrary.,such,inexplicable,them,devised
To solve these two questions_ it is necessary to be previously acquainted with the analysis of the * substance_ and of the products of the fermentation.,fermentable,twentyeight,airpump,familiarise
Hence_ since from must of grapes we procure alkohol and * acid_ I have an undoubted right to suppose that must consists of carbonic acid and alkohol.,carbonic,possess,striking,fatty
By a long train * experiments_ made in various ways_ and often repeated_ I ascertained that the proportion in which these ingredients exist in sugar_ are nearly eight parts of hydrogen_ 64 parts of oxygen_ and 28 parts of charcoal_ all by weight_ forming 100 parts of sugar.,of,capsules,trituration,recompose
Sugar must be mixed with about four times its weight of water_ to render it * of fermentation; and even then the equilibrium of its elements would remain undisturbed_ without the assistance of some substance_ to give a commencement to the fermentation.,susceptible,consumed,unknown,quae

The phenomena of putrefaction are caused_ like * of vinous fermentation_ by the operation of very complicated affinities.,those,liquors,declivity,condensation
The constituent elements of the bodies submitted to this process cease to continue in equilibrium in the threefold combination_ and form themselves anew into binary combinations_ or compounds_ consisting of two elements only; but these are entirely different from the * produced by the vinous fermentation.,results,compression,another,inner
Thus putrefaction is nothing more than a complete analysis of vegetable substance_ during which the whole of the constituent elements is disengaged in form of gas_ * the earth_ which remains in the state of mould.,except,spring,attaining,undertake
Such is the * of putrefaction when the substances submitted to it contain only oxygen_ hydrogen_ charcoal and a little earth.,result,blotting,anno,sake
But this case is rare_ and these substances putrify imperfectly and with difficulty_ and require a * time to complete their putrefaction.,considerable,observe,despair,joint

The acetous fermentation is nothing more than the acidification or oxygenation of wine_ produced * the open air by means of the absorption of oxygen.,in,explosions,elegant,capacity
The resulting acid * the acetous acid_ commonly called Vinegar_ which is composed of hydrogen and charcoal united together in proportions not yet ascertained_ and changed into the acid state by oxygen.,is,colourless,let,mostly
Independent of the proofs which these facts furnish of the acetous acid being produced by the oxygenation of wine_ an experiment made by Mr Chaptal_ Professor of Chemistry at Montpellier_ gives us a distinct * of what takes place in this process.,view,vegetables,softened,slightest
He impregnated * with about its own bulk of carbonic acid from fermenting beer_ and placed this water in a cellar in vessels communicating with the air_ and in a short time the whole was converted into acetous acid.,water,published,collection,account
The carbonic acid gas procured from beer vats in fermentation is not perfectly pure_ but contains a small quantity of alkohol in solution_ wherefore water impregnated with it contains all the materials necessary for * the acetous acid.,forming,glue,registered,reagents
The alkohol furnishes hydrogen and one portion of charcoal_ * carbonic acid furnishes oxygen and the rest of the charcoal_ and the air of the atmosphere furnishes the rest of the oxygen necessary for changing the mixture into acetous acid.,the,ballast,bars,that
Although the principal facts relating to the acetous acid are well known_ yet numerical exactitude is still wanting_ till furnished by more exact * than any hitherto performed; wherefore I shall not enlarge any farther upon the subject.,experiments,vague,proper,different
It is sufficiently shown by what has been said_ that the constitution of all the vegetable acids and oxyds is exactly conformable to the formation of *; but farther experiments are necessary to teach us the proportion of the constituent elements in all these acids and oxyds.,vinegar,dephlogisticated,experience,argil
We may easily perceive_ however_ that this part of chemistry_ like all the rest of its divisions_ * rapid progress towards perfection_ and that it is already rendered greatly more simple than was formerly believed.,makes,distinctly,intense,complicated

We shall find the means no less simple and diversified_ and as abundantly productive of forms and qualities_ in the order of bodies * are now about to treat of.,we,filed,saltpetre,noxious
Acidifiable substances_ by combining with oxygen_ and their * conversion into acids_ acquire great susceptibility of farther combination; they become capable of uniting with earthy and metallic bodies_ by which means neutral salts are formed.,consequent,crucibles,rufa,was
Acids may therefore * considered as true salifying principles_ and the substances with which they unite to form neutral salts may be called salifiable bases: The nature of the union which these two principles form with each other is meant as the subject of the present chapter.,be,perpetually,y,aqua
This view of the acids prevents me from considering them as salts_ though they are possessed of many of the principal properties of saline bodies_ as solubility in *_ &c.,water,depending,lifeless,advanced

The neutral salts_ on the contrary_ are of a * order of combination_ being formed by the union of two mixts with each other_ and may therefore be termed compounds.,secondary,feeds,arm,head

The whole vegetable is thus * into water and carbonic acid_ and nothing remains but a small portion of gray earthy matter called ashes_ being the only really fixed principles which enter into the constitution of vegetables.,reduced,instead,inconvenient,spars
The earth_ or rather ashes_ which seldom exceeds a twentieth part of the weight of the vegetable_ contains a substance of a particular nature_ known under the * of fixed vegetable alkali_ or potash.,name,floated,ice,malat
To obtain it_ water is poured upon the ashes_ which dissolves the potash_ and leaves the ashes which are insoluble; by afterwards evaporating the water_ we obtain the potash in * white concrete form: It is very fixed even in a very high degree of heat.,a,engenders,vats,gave
I do not mean here to describe the art of preparing *_ or the method of procuring it in a state of purity_ but have entered upon the above detail that I might not use any word not previously explained.,potash,receiving,wandering,filtring
Although the carbonic acid has less affinity with potash than any other acid_ yet it is difficult to * the last portions from it.,separate,paste,external,noise
The most * method of accomplishing this is to dissolve the potash in water; to this solution add two or three times its weight of quick-lime_ then filtrate the liquor and evaporate it in close vessels; the saline substance left by the evaporation is potash almost entirely deprived of carbonic acid.,usual,reciprocal,products,truly
In this state it is soluble in an equal weight of water_ and even attracts the moisture of the air with great avidity; by this property it furnishes us with an * means of rendering air or gas dry by exposing them to its action.,excellent,conversions,quod,seem

To separate these substances it is first combined with an acid_ * muriatic for instance_ and then disengaged from that combination by the addition of lime or potash.,the,drawn,obtain,way

It is necessary to remark_ that earths * alkalies unite with acids to form neutral salts without the intervention of any medium_ whereas metallic substances are incapable of forming this combination without being previously less or more oxygenated; strictly speaking_ therefore_ metals are not soluble in acids_ but only metallic oxyds.,and,precision,contributes,deriving
The explanation of the principal * of metallic solution depends entirely upon this simple observation_ which was overlooked even by the illustrious Bergman.,phenomena,liquifies,iris,from
The second phenomenon is_ that_ when the metals have been previously oxydated_ they all dissolve in acids without effervescence: This is easily explained; because_ not having now any * for combining with oxygen_ they neither decompose the acid nor the water by which_ in the former case_ the effervescence is occasioned.,occasion,clays,fulmination,pots
A third phenomenon_ which requires particular *_ is_ that none of the metals produce effervescence by solution in oxygenated muriatic acid.,consideration,recommended,baking,trials
During this process * metal_ in the first place_ carries off the excess of oxygen from the oxygenated muriatic acid_ by which it becomes oxydated_ and reduces the acid to the state of ordinary muriatic acid.,the,aëriform,mountains,truths
The fourth phenomenon is_ that metals are absolutely insoluble in such acids as have their bases joined to oxygen by a stronger affinity than * metals are capable of exerting upon that acidifying principle.,these,instruments,can,rigorous

The best method hitherto known for determining the quantities of substances submitted to chemical experiment_ or resulting from them_ is by means of * accurately constructed beam and scales_ with properly regulated weights_ which well known operation is called weighing.,an,suppositions,flannel,commonly

This variation is of infinite consequence to be well understood * commerce and in the arts; but_ in chemistry_ it is of no moment what particular denomination of weight be employed_ provided the results of experiments be expressed in convenient fractions of the same denomination.,in,greased,curious,vapours

When * law of the compression of elastic fluids is once well understood_ it becomes easily applicable to the corrections necessary in pneumato chemical experiments upon the volume of gas_ in relation to its pressure.,this,earnestly,high,learned

This air is therefore less compressed than the atmosphere at the mean height of the barometer_ and consequently occupies more space than it would occupy at the mean pressure_ the difference * exactly proportional to the difference between the compressing weights.,being,n,sustain,lakes

Hence_ no new combustions or oxygenations can happen without destroying this equilibrium_ and raising the combustible substances to a * degree of temperature.,superior,states,bored,manipulation
When this degree is once produced_ * commences_ and the caloric which is disengaged by the decomposition of the oxygen gas keeps up the temperature necessary for continuing combustion.,combustion,conveyed,poured,magnitude
When this * not the case_ that is_ when the disengaged caloric is insufficient for keeping up the necessary temperature_ the combustion ceases: This circumstance is expressed in common language by saying_ that a body burns ill_ or with difficulty.,is,recollect,cool,chemical
Although combustion possesses some * in common with distillation_ especially with the compound kind of that operation_ they differ in a very material point.,circumstances,nullities,particles,fish
The necessity of employing oxygen in the state of gas in all experiments with combustion_ and the * determination of the quantities employed_ render this kind of operations peculiarly troublesome.,rigorous,adjust,weak,liquifaction
As almost all the products of combustion are disengaged in the state of gas_ it is still more difficult to retain them than even those furnished during compound distillation; hence this precaution was entirely neglected by the ancient chemists; and this set of experiments exclusively * to modern chemistry.,belong,maxims,worms,taken
Having thus pointed out_ * a general way_ the objects to be had in view in experiments upon combustion_ I proceed_ in the following sections of this chapter_ to describe the different instruments I have used with this view.,in,volume,minutes,attaining
The following arrangement is formed_ not upon the nature of the combustible bodies_ but upon that of the instruments necessary * combustion.,for,own,fluids,putrefactive

In this manner of operating_ a small quantity of common air gets into the jar_ but it is so very * as not to injure either the progress or accuracy of the experiment in any sensible degree.,inconsiderable,something,circumstance,accelerates

Real solutions are produced by fire_ or by introducing and accumulating a great quantity of caloric between the particles of bodies; and this * of solution in caloric is usually called fusion.,species,greased,salts,followed

This furnace can only produce a moderate degree of heat_ because * quantity of charcoal it is capable of consuming is limited by the quantity of air which is allowed to pass through the opening G of the ash-hole.,the,detailed,worthy,condensation

To remedy * defect_ there ought to be two openings GG to the ash-hole; one of these is shut up when only a moderate fire is required; and both are kept open when the strongest power of the furnace is to be exerted.,this,surfaces,acquired,appears
The opening of the dome SS ought likewise to be considerably larger than is * made.,usually,flat,essential,sure
It is of great importance not to employ retorts of too large size in proportion to the furnace_ as a sufficient space ought always to be allowed * the passage of the air between the sides of the furnace and the vessel.,for,collets,rid,article

To prevent the bottom of the retort from being either heated or coolled too suddenly_ it is sometimes placed in a small sand-bath of baked clay_ standing upon the * bars of the furnace.,cross,ages,stoppers,stood

There must be some heated air above the opening AB_ and the superior * of this ought likewise to be taken into consideration; but_ as this portion is continually coolled and carried off by the external air_ it cannot produce any great effect.,levity,arising,descend,arrested
From these reflections it follows_ that the first foot of tube added to a furnace produces more effect than the sixth_ and the sixth more than the tenth; but * have no data to ascertain at what height we ought to stop.,we,themselves,fixes,decimal
This limit of useful addition is so much the farther in proportion as the materials of the tube are weaker conductors of *_ because the air will thereby be so much less coolled; hence baked earth is much to be preferred to plate iron.,heat,ethiops,instant,rushes
As the fire-place is the * part of a furnace_ and the part where the air is most dilated in its passage_ this part ought to be made with a considerable widening or belly.,hottest,moisture,reproached,diminution
This is the more necessary_ as it is intended to contain the charcoal * crucible_ as well as for the passage of the air which supports_ or rather produces the combustion; hence we only allow the interstices between the coals for the passage of the air.,and,widening,pulverulent,refer

It was therefore necessary to contrive a particular apparatus_ in which the metal should be at the same time exposed to the influence of violent heat_ and defended from contact with air rendered incombustible by * passage through burning coals.,its,future,silicious,eight
