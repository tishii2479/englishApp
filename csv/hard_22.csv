Sir Richard Strongman_ Lord Strapmore_ and the Honourable Thomas Rowbotham have each entered three or four of their horses in an important handicap_ what is more natural_ on the turf_ than that they should lay their heads together to \"best\" the public_ and pull off a good thing at long odds for themselves?

In order_ *_ to do the best they can for themselves_ the three gentlemen named above resolve to call to their aid a well-known turf commissioner_ one Mr. Dudley Smooth.,then,fearless,places,(1825)

\"Quite so_ Sir Richard and as only one_ * know_ can win_ the thing is to discover it.,you,road,ounces,\"nobbled\"
What was generally resolved upon to begin * was_ that each of those present should_ a month before the race_ find out by means of a formal trial his best horse for the handicap at the published weights next_ that in a couple of days thereafter the three should be tried together along with the best public horse they were able to buy or borrow to take part in the trial at a weight agreed upon.,with,rivalled,void—a,larger
