* nowadays is a \"business\" of importance requiring large dealings with the telegraph but long ago—say about the close of the \"thirties_\" and in the \"forties\" of the present century_ when the writer became interested in horse-racing_ consequent on having won a few sovereigns by the victory of Merry Monarch in the Derby—tipping was much less obtrusive than it is to-day_ and was carried on chiefly by means of what may be called \"disguises.,Tipping,sober,£30000,haunts
\" Such announcements * were made public usually bore that the advertiser was in exclusive possession of information about a horse which was certain to win the Derby or some other important race but_ as a rule_ the great event decided at Epsom was_ in the beginning of tipping_ the race most favoured_ and the person advertising not seldom posed as \"a gentleman's valet out of a place_\" or as \"a stableman dying of consumption_\" or \"an old military man_\" or as some person very remote from the being he really was.,as,Barbs,missy,race-horses\"
\"Who_ then_\" it will be asked_ \"were those persons?\" Well_ as there were not so many of them as there are to-day_ when \"tipping_\" as was said a few months ago to a magistrate_ is a \"profession_\" it will not prove a difficult task to give information about their ways of working_ as I happen to be able to speak with some degree of knowledge of two or three of the number who were among the first to advertise in days when the mediums for such * were anything but numerous_ and advertising was somewhat costly_ there being then an advertisement duty of one shilling and sixpence exigible on each announcement_ whilst postage was also expensive.,announcements,death's,prints,capacity

The man_ before he began work as a tipster_ had been for several years under butler in one of the big Pall Mall clubs_ and having drawn the winner of the Chester Cup in a plethoric \"sweep\"—many of which used to be_ and I believe still are_ organised in London in connection with the more important races—he found himself in possession of sufficient funds_ including the money he had saved in *_ to become lessee of a public-house in a little street off Fetter Lane_ in which for a time he did well_ so well that he took courage and married_ his wife being able to assist him in his business.,service,manor,mourning,(233)
It is almost needless to say_ with a landlord possessed of a taste for the turf_ his house came in time to be much frequented by the smaller fry of sporting men having tastes in common and * fond of betting_ although the sums risked seldom exceeded half-a-crown_ or at most double that amount.,being,saying,course,watching
One evil day a constant frequenter of the house introduced a friend of his_ who was anxious to start * betting list_ and as Wingrave_ the landlord_ thought a list in the house would improve his business_ he gave consent_ and Bill Holmes commenced business at the \"Caxton Arms.,a,cigars,priced,\"blood

Holmes was unfortunately unable to come to \"the scratch\" over the animal which did win_ and knowing he could not meet the claims which would be made against him on behalf of the winner_ which had been heavily backed at his list_ he at once left London_ to the great consternation of Wingrave_ who dreaded he would in some way be held responsible for the misdeeds of * runaway list-keeper.,the,usurers,lodgings,patent

Nothing in the public-house line of business being likely to turn up_ Wingrave_ by the advice of his shrewd wife (her father had been a pugilist_ and afterwards * of a gin-shop in the region of Lambeth)_ turned tipster_ and under the designation of \"a retired club steward_\" offered to give all who pleased to forward half-a-crown to his house in Pemberton Row the name of a horse which would win the Derby or to those who entrusted him with double that amount_ he promised_ in addition_ to give the name of a filly that would be first in the Oaks_ and so ensure a remunerative double event.,lessee,\"traps,befallen,trimmings

Two or three successful tips enabled a man to play \"the game\" to a remunerative tune for at east six months every * he advertised he obtained numerous replies on the strength of his previous successes.,time,occasional,tends,admitted
* the advent of the \"retired club steward\" there was a person at work whose success as a tipster was the subject of much gossip among needy bettors this was the lady tipster already referred to.,Before,good-looking,poor,fountain-head
Yes_ a veritable woman_ and clever at * work! I first heard about her in \"Jessop's_\" a night house in Catherine Street_ among the frequenters of which her tips seemed to have made an impression.,the,cloth,Aintree,balloted

\" The name of this female foreteller of turf events was said to be Adelaide Merryweather she was_ so I was told by some of the \"knowing ones\" who frequented \"Jessop's_\" the widow of an actor who had been engaged for a time in one of the then transpontine theatres as * delineator of small parts.,a,utilise,agents,swells
The woman's own name was Weather_ her husband's name being Merry_ and the  she adopted as a prophetess was a combination of the two but she traded in tips under other names as *_ one of them being John Screwman.,well,Militia,Archive,Binks
Her house_ or at least one of the places to which her letters were sent_ was in Chapel Street_ Soho Square_ and_ as the postman of the period would have been able to testify_ she carried * a thriving business.,on,resolved,hear,revise
Another of the names assumed by Mrs. Merryweather * she put on her prophetic mantle was_ if my memory is not proving treacherous_ \"Arthur Lancefield_ late of Middleham.,when,style,race-horse,Holborn
\" I am writing only what I know_ or what I believe from trustworthy information to be true_ and my belief is that Mrs. Merryweather was_ if not the \"inventor\" of the method of sending the names of different horses * different batches of applicants_ one of the earliest tipsters to adopt and systematise the plan.,to,island,12,know\"
Trading as she did under three or four _ she speedily accumulated a long list of names of persons who backed horses so * when she adopted another name and changed her address_ she could send circulars to former customers stating that_ from private information which she had received_ she believed Mr. Brown Jones (or any other person) was anxious to find out the winner of the Derby (or whatever race might be on the tapis)_ and that_ on receiving half-a-crown_ a rare double event would be forwarded to his address.,that,nobleman,passage,babble

For three or four years Mrs. Merryweather experienced a prosperous time_ customers being numerous_ as_ by * of her system of sending different horses to different persons one or more batches of them were certain to have had winners sent to them_ and these fortunate ones were not slow to sound the trumpet of her fame among their friends_ so that on some occasions she enjoyed a run of success.,means,horse-racing,Purse,Crown\"

About the year 1842 or 1843 (I am not sure which of these years it was)_ I went one evening to Sadler's Wells Theatre to witness the play of _ and after the tragedy I supped with one of the actors in his lodgings * Arlington Street_ near the theatre.,in,exceeded,stole,experienced
We were joined at table by a fellow-lodger of my *_ who seemed to know nothing but what savoured of the turf_ and he was so complaisant as to tell me the names of several horses which were pretty certain to win_ and_ as I know_ did win some of the coming events.,friend,Grange,dividends,expiry

His plan is to select about ten or a dozen of the most likely horses and send a different one to win the race and another_ or perhaps two others_ to get places_ to each of his customers_ taking care_ of *_ to keep a record of what he does_ and the names and addresses of those who correspond with him.,course,sheriffs,Prizes,1876

I suspect_ however_ it is with him as it often is with others similarly *_ a case of 'lightly come_ lightly go.,circumstanced,brace,1776,Cwrw

Previous even to the period I have been attempting to illustrate there was being published a regular racing circular_ the precursor of the  of a later period_ whilst newspaper tipping_ especially in the columns of certain of the London weekly newspapers_ was greatly extended in not a few of them a \"real poet\" gushed forth his prophetic lore_ and_ as has been stated already_ not a few of the poetic predictions perpetrated some fifty years ago were exceedingly felicitous in their diction_ considering the sometimes very uncouth matter that * of necessity to be dealt with.,had,horse',York,puts
I remember reading upon one occasion a collection of such poems in a Bow Street tavern (it was kept_ I think_ by Baron Nicholson)_ and of being struck with the halting lines and bald phraseology of * or four of the Seven Dials sort_ that used at one time to be hawked round the public-houses at which sporting men were wont to congregate.,three,include,loss,provides
In respect of the art of really \"poetical\" tipping_ * are few who know how very difficult it is to render the matter presentable the names to be introduced are sometimes not amenable to the treatment of the poet_ no matter how heartily he enters on his task.,there,better,road,humour
As one gentleman said to the writer_ \"to work all these probable starters into readable rhymes_ far less to clothe them with some degree of poetic fancy_ would need a couple of Tennysons_ four Brownings_ and half a score each of Swinburnes and Buchanans rolled into one_ and even then the * of the lot united might not seem to the editor all it ought to be.,product,client,thee,web
Nowadays every newspaper of importance * to furnish a daily modicum of sporting intelligence_ which proprietors find to be a costly item in the ever increasing sum of their expenditure.,has,book,Queen,decadence
But it is a circumstance that cannot be helped there is in reality more interest taken in the * for the Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire by five-sixths of the readers of the daily papers than there is in all the other items of news added together indeed_ it is not going too far to affirm that two or three of the daily newspapers are indebted for the larger portion of their sales to the fact of their giving every morning a detailed programme for the races of the day_ as well as other sporting intelligence.,handicaps,Flint,victimised,magnitude
Excellent information of its kind is purveyed by the members of the sporting press_ who contribute to these journals but the tips given are_ except to the merest novices_ of little use_ as veteran bettors can_ by the aid of their  or *_ select horses for themselves.,,However,earning,assiduity
In addition to the racing news contained in the ordinary run of newspapers_ there are three daily journals published all the year round which are solely devoted to sporting news_ and these papers deal of course in \"tips_\" and some of them afford a place in their columns to a full score of the daily increasing army of vaticinators and yet_ as must be patent * those who devote time and attention to the study of such matters_ no betting man could possibly make a fortune_ or even earn a living_ by abjectly following either or all of the honest newspaper tipsters referred to.,to,moderation,deliver,talk
It is amusing to note * some of the more \"screeching\" of the newspapers comport themselves.,how,places?,(\"History,popularity
When one of them_ for instance_ after a period of six or seven *_ becomes some day so fortunate as to select three or four horses that win as many races_ it shouts out next day in loud tones so that all may have news of its prescience—a supremely Irish mode of telling readers that to follow its tips would be ruinous.,weeks,quaint,Walker's,taking

But what of that_ when backers of the two lost their money_ the romping in horse starting at odds of 3 to 1 on him! Let us suppose that some sanguine speculator had risked a five-pound note on each selection (because when two horses are selected it is necessary to back both in case of missing the *_ the result would have been a loss of £5 on No.,winner),£200000,brain,registered

These details will not probably be pleasant to the gentlemen of the sporting press but there are among them several who have no occasion to assume that my remarks are personal_ because they are persons possessed of knowledge_ who announce their selections in a modest *_ and give good reasons for their faith but for the kind of tipster who told his readers not only that Pioneer would win the race for the City and Suburban Handicap_ but would do easily_ I have but scanty respect.,manner,hunting-field,contemplated,unsteady
That tipster must surely be a green hand at the business! Why did he not add that if the horse did not win easily he would eat * \"Will win_\" instead of \"may win_\" is a mistake in tipping often committed by some even of the veteran press tipsters.,him?,executes,resort,Makeless

His idea of the kind of persons he had supposed them to be was at once corroborated_ as the first of them with whom he could obtain an interview he immediately recognised as a bookmaker who had welshed him at Ascot two years before another of the fraternity was identified by a friend as a \"swell cabman_\" who used to have a lucrative connection in the City_ his customers being chiefly stockbrokers and bankers' clerks but more surprising than either of these was the discovery that among the motley crowd_ and evidently_ from the fact of two * in an outer office being busily engaged in filling up telegraphic forms_ doing a roaring trade_ there was a younger son of a very well known and wealthy London citizen_ who_ having failed at the University_ and \"gone to the bad\" in business_ had taken to tipping.,clerks,Dog,H.,Drummer
Could a census be taken of these prophets_ embracing their antecedents_ it would be found that not a few of them were persons who had lost money in backing horses or in laying the odds against their chances_ reminding us of the celebrated definition * the critics being \"men who have failed in literature and art.,of,bridled,Derby\",superintended

One or two of the present-day tipsters correspond with \"gentlemen only_\" but on being communicated with_ these persons do not seem particularly * to restrict the number of their clients what they really want is \"a remittance.,anxious,money-giving,occasional,veteran
\" * the present time there are tipsters who carry on business in different fashions some ask for a fee that will cover a week's work_ others seek an all-day remittance_ whilst not a few deal in single-horse wires or \"paddock snips_\" as they designate their information.,At,Its,state,inattention
