Persian fathers and * are often very fond of their little girls_ but there is no doubt that they very much prefer boys.,mothers,detailed,working,poorer

Perhaps one reason for preferring boys is that the * marry so young_ just as they might begin to be of some use to their mothers and the father has to pay a sum of money to his daughter’s husband on her marriage.,girls,explains,Zoroastrians,good
A son_ on the other hand_ does not generally marry till he is * up_ and then he almost invariably brings his little wife home and continues to live with his parents.,grown,heavy,elders’,nightingales

As * have found that_ in spite of appearances_ ‘Ali Muhammad after all wears trousers_ we may perhaps find that his sister_ Rubabeh_ wears a skirt_ and so indeed she does_ but it is so short as not to be very noticeable indoors_ while out of doors it is completely hidden by the big baggy over-trousers_ gathered in at the ankles and footed_ which she wears when she goes in the street.,we,fair,Hikāyat\",kindly
