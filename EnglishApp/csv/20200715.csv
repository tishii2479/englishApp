Gully_ gathering experience day by day_ was soon able to play a prominent part in the heavy speculations which formed a feature of the turf in those times; and whenever he thought any commission entrusted to him was a really good one—that is to say_ as denoting the chance of the horse to win—he followed the lead of his employer_ and by doing so often won considerable sums; * if he knew_ as he frequently did_ that a horse was sure to be beaten_ he would spiritedly lay the odds against its chance of winning.,whilst,Orlando-Canezou,odds),loudly
"It is recorded that on one occasion he was engaged * back two horses in a race to win_ and_ along with a confederate_ he had five to lay against; the two which he backed to win ran first and second_ the others_ as had been ""arranged_"" came in a long way behind the winner.",to,much-talked-of,waited,circles
