It is necessary to state this much plainly_ because when a paper or an article pertaining to the \"great national sport\" appears in a review or magazine_ it is at * stigmatised by the sporting journals as containing only \"pipers' news_\" and in the view of the critics it may be so but such articles are not written to instruct the critics_ but to inform the public.,once,lightly,garrulous,intend

It will_ perhaps_ be thought by some persons that the dark side of things is too much dwelt upon in the following pages_ that too much is said about the frauds and chicaneries of the turf_ and too little about the brighter aspects of the sport_ but it must be borne in mind that racing has unfortunately become a \"business\" * the most sordid kind the majority of the men engaged in the \"sport\" run their horses only as \"instruments of gambling_\" whilst not a few of them to ensure success condescend to practices that will not bear the light of day.,of,hoisted,strains,reporters

A remarkable set of rules for the guidance of those taking part in the competition for the original Town * was devised in this reign_ and_ as will be evident from the following extracts_ afforded a foundation for many of the rules of racing_ which afterwards came in use all over England.,Plate,£15000,eaten,tones
One of the rules is worded as follows: \"Every horse that rideth shall be bridled_ saddled_ and shod_ and his rider shall weigh twelve stone_ fourteen pounds to the stone_ and every rider that wanteth above one pound and a half * he hath rid the heat_ shall win no plate or prize.,after,Copyright,subscription-room,finely

Betting and \"turf profligacy\" of all kinds were in these times indulged in at Newmarket to an extent far beyond the bounds of morality and prudence_ and_ although King and Court were_ so to put it_ in \"the * of all that occurred_ an Act of Parliament required to be passed to restrain gaming and betting on race-horses to an excessive amount \"on tick or credit.,swim\",performance,jurisdiction,Spitfire

In 1810_ there were but two days of sport_ the money run for being a little over £200. Nor up till the year 1827 was there much improvement till 1825 the public money subscribed did not total up to a large sum_ it varied from £80 to £300_ whilst the money received as sweepstakes amounted to something between £60 and £600. Two years later_ as has been stated_ a great improvement began in the financial resources of the meeting_ as was obvious enough from the amount of money which was run for_ the total sum in that year exceeding £2_000.

It may be mentioned here that when on a particular occasion a Queen's Plate_ usually run for at the popular Scottish Musselburgh meeting_ was disallowed by Parliament_ at the instigation of a Radical member of the House of Commons_ the clerk of the course_ Mr. James Turner_ along with some friends_ conceived the idea of replacing the disallowed trophy by a \"People's Plate\" of the same value_ £100 a subscription was *_ and the requisite sum of money was obtained in the course of a day or two_ mostly in pence.,suggested,angle,recommending,\"made

Many curious anecdotes have_ from time to time_ been circulated about the doings of various officers of the turf_ not * few of them_ perhaps_ of a rather imaginative kind.,a,obnoxious,weighed,intelligently
In one or two instances where the clerk of the course acted also as handicapper_ as well as being lessee of the grand stand_ it is said that it was his custom to \"retain\" all the big stakes in plain language_ it has been more than once implied that some handicappers were allowed_ by certain owners_ to keep the stake-money_ on condition of the horses entered by them being favoured in * apportioning of the weights.,the,See,concept,Medora

Not till 1831 did the entry in any year exceed one hundred horses so that up to that date_ if all the subscribers paid their money_ the value of the Derby—the figure was greatly dependent_ of course_ on the number of horses that came to the starting-post—would very seldom reach a sum of £3_000.

But it is a circumstance that cannot be helped there is in reality more interest taken in the handicaps for the Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire by five-sixths of the readers of the daily papers than there is in all the other items of news added together indeed_ it is not going too far to affirm that two or three of the daily newspapers are indebted for the larger * of their sales to the fact of their giving every morning a detailed programme for the races of the day_ as well as other sporting intelligence.,portion,Croydon,Twenty-four,Smithfield

In addition to the racing news contained in the ordinary run of newspapers_ there are three daily journals published all the year round which are solely devoted to sporting news_ and these papers deal of course * \"tips_\" and some of them afford a place in their columns to a full score of the daily increasing army of vaticinators and yet_ as must be patent to those who devote time and attention to the study of such matters_ no betting man could possibly make a fortune_ or even earn a living_ by abjectly following either or all of the honest newspaper tipsters referred to.,in,room,reply,itself

But what of that_ when backers of the two lost their money_ the romping in horse starting * odds of 3 to 1 on him!

These details will not probably * pleasant to the gentlemen of the sporting press but there are among them several who have no occasion to assume that my remarks are personal_ because they are persons possessed of knowledge_ who announce their selections in a modest manner_ and give good reasons for their faith but for the kind of tipster who told his readers not only that Pioneer would win the race for the City and Suburban Handicap_ but would do easily_ I have but scanty respect.,be,dishonestly,indulging,Spider

His idea of the kind of persons he had supposed them to be was at once corroborated_ as the first of them with whom he could obtain an interview he immediately recognised as a bookmaker who had welshed him at Ascot two years before another of the fraternity was identified by a friend as a \"swell cabman_\" who used to have a lucrative connection in the City_ his customers being chiefly stockbrokers and bankers' clerks but more surprising than either of these was the discovery that among the motley crowd_ and evidently_ from the fact of two clerks in an outer office being busily engaged in filling up telegraphic forms_ doing a roaring trade_ there was a younger son of a very well known and wealthy London citizen_ who_ having failed at the University_ and \"gone * the bad\" in business_ had taken to tipping.,to,Cumberland,Gabriel,Musselburgh
Could a census be taken of these prophets_ embracing their antecedents_ it would be found that not a few of them were persons who had lost money in backing horses or in laying the odds against their chances_ reminding us of the celebrated definition of the critics being \"men who * failed in literature and art.,have,against,any,offer

The proprietors of several weekly racing periodicals at present published_ not satisfied seemingly with the sales of fifty or sixty thousand copies which they say their papers attain_ send out daily tips by telegraph_ or pen nightly letters to all who will pay the requisite fee_ and according to their own accounts of what they achieve their success as tipsters is enormous but it may be fairly stated on behalf of the gentlemen who cater sporting news for the daily *_ that considering the difficulties incidental to the formulating of their prophetic work_ they do wonderfully well_ although it has been often stated against them_ as a matter of reproach_ that they \"follow the money\"—in other words_ tip those horses which are being or are likely to be heavily backed.,press,friends,buildings,oath

No data exists to show when the professional bookmaker as we know him came upon the scene but it may be taken for granted that the \"penciller\" was not evolved at once_ but that the system grew by means of what it fed on_ originating_ doubtless_ in the practice adopted by certain gentlemen who_ having made a series of *_ were anxious in consequence to get \"round_\" as the process of hedging is called_ or_ in other words_ to be in a position not to lose their money_ or_ to put the matter still more explicitly_ to possess a fair chance of winning something and losing nothing.,bets,summing,or,evident
At the beginning of racing_ and for a considerable time thereafter_ what little betting occurred took place chiefly on the racecourses but as time elapsed several men distinguished themselves_ or_ at least_ became notorious_ as \"betting men_\" both giving and taking the odds all round_ and accepting the odium of sometimes being called \"legs\" (blacklegs) by such persons as only made single bets_ and objected to the wholesale modes of betting which were * into fashion.,coming,accomplished,\"He's,animal

Several of the gentlemen who owned race-horses soon discovered that the mere winning of a stake by means of any particular race_ however large the sum run for might be_ did not reimburse them for the outlays which they had to make by keeping a stud of horses * the horse became an instrument of gambling_ and remains so at the present time.,hence,intention,shoulders,1.E.3.

There are many_ some even well versed in turf affairs_ who probably think it almost impossible that Loates_ Canon_ or Barrett or some equally clever horseman_ could be unsuccessful for seven consecutive turns but should the jockey selected prove unsuccessful even four times running_ and then at the fifth trial score a win_ the very meagre price usually offered against a popular rider proving victorious—indeed_ the horse entrusted to him very often starts with odds *  it—renders the winning account_ on most occasions_ anything but profitable.,betted,£50000,palm,Tattersall's

The writer of these pages_ as is obvious enough_ is quite of the same opinion as Mr. Day_ that \"so long as a man can go into the ring and bet his untold thousands upon race after race_ not having as many hundreds to pay his losses with_ so long as he can find usurers * supply him with the needful to be paid on the Monday after_ then so long_ too_ will he continue to bet_ little caring what he pays for the convenience as things are he is compelled to raise funds to save his credit and his respect among his aristocratic associates_ but in the other case (of Pari-mutuel betting) there would not be such pressing necessity for him to have the money.,to,outlay,received,reproach

And that is my preface to the following little sketch of Gully and Ridsdale_ who were * the chief racing adventurers of their time.,among,account),lasts,provocative
Both men were * humble origin.,of,codes,sermons,achieving
Ridsdale was born in York_ and earned a small wage in his early days as helper in * livery stable_ from which he was promoted to be a groom to the first Earl of Durham_ then Mr. Lambton.,a,Strictly,deserve,adverted
Robert Ridsdale after a time_ having given up service_ made * appearance on the turf as an adventurer_ and from the first success appears to have attended his efforts.,his,philanthropic,agents,resisted
He * formed an extensive and profitable acquaintance with many of the northern trainers and jockeys_ who at the period_ say from 1815 onwards_ were busy in the racing world the sport of kings at the time indicated being in a flourishing condition in the North_ where the training stables were crowded with famous horses_ the riders of which had earned reputations on the turf.,had,stories,customary,wallop
Ridsdale was fortunate_ as the saying goes_ to get into many of the \"good things\" of those days_ and_ judging by the fine establishment he was speedily enabled to set up in the neighbourhood of York_ he must_ * at the outset of his turf career_ have discovered a way of \"making\" large sums of money.,almost,Ludlow,Rubens,sweepstakes
Among his patrons was the Honourable Edward Petre_ who for some years_ \"in the days when * the Fourth was king_\" enjoyed the favours of fortune on the racecourse_ having won the St. Leger on four different occasions_ three of his wins being in consecutive years.,George,opportunity,Corkin,steered
John Gully was a racing man of great notoriety_ * became a Member of Parliament.,and,Bookmakers,King,large
In his earlier years * is known to have played the parts of butcher_ prize-fighter_ publican_ hell-keeper_ and bookmaker_ carrying on at one time a gigantic business in the latter capacity.,he,alert,farrier,everywhere
Gully was a pugilist in those days when * was most thought of_ and when fighting men were patronised by persons of honour and respectability.,boxing,buried,lodging,\"noble\"
As a boxer_ Gully was a man of indomitable courage_ as plucky in the roped arena as his partner Ridsdale was * the hunting-field.,in,brisk,vehicle,claimed
It was while carrying on business as a publican that Gully saw his way to fortune in * betting ring like some other shrewd persons_ he early discovered that \"backing\" horses was an unprofitable avocation_ having come to the conclusion that the chief gains of the turf remained in the hands of the men who laid the odds.,the,colts,transaction,basis
\"Backers_\" as they are called_ * down before the bookmakers like so many ninepins_ whilst the layers of the odds to all comers continue to stand up and grow rich.,go,effected,mercenary,employing
Impressed with that view of the situation_ Gully * became a professional betting man_ or \"leg_\" as such persons were then termed_ and_ by paying intelligent attention to business_ met with prompt and extraordinary success.,speedily,Bromford,mare,party
He commenced at a fortunate time—just_ indeed_ as betting was beginning to be recognised as a business_ and when men were awakening more and more to the fact that it was better for them to deal * a professional layer of the odds all round than to make bets with each other.,with,\"Burglar,Till,wrote
Gully speedily * attention in the ring.,attracted,\"principle\",transaction,utilised
Gentlemen who had taken notice of his native shrewdness and capacity for figures entrusted him with commissions to back their horses_ so that_ in a manner_ fortune was thrust upon him_ the many secrets he became possessed of in this line of business enabling him to work in a powerful light_ whilst his less fortunate brethren of the ring had to carry on their betting work pretty * in the dark.,much,connection,vitality\",divided
The commissions with which he was so frequently entrusted showed Gully what were the expectations of owners_ and not only which horses might win_ but also some as well which were sure to be beaten because on the turf there was then_ as there is now_ two kinds of \"commissions\"—one to back a given horse_ or it might be two * three horses_ for the same event_ the other to lay against animals meant to lose.,or,\"no,Jenison,affairs\"
With \"such dispositions of things\" in his favour_ he is a poor * at the business who cannot_ when the struggle is over_ show a winning balance.,hand,\"astuteness,name,Station
* days of Gully were those of heavy betting_ so far as individual speculation was concerned that is to say_ there might then be a hundred men on the turf who betted to stakes of hundreds or thousands but at the present time_ although individual bets are not perhaps made to such large amounts_ the number of persons who bet is as hundreds to one to what the number was when John Gully was a prominent person in the ring.,The,woollen,contribute,—Her
At the \"period\" referred to_ say from about 1818 to 1840_ race-horses were less numerous * they are at present_ and bookmakers_ moreover_ were not so plentiful as now but most of them managed to do a good business and to put money in their purses.,than,\"best\",horse-breeding,commencement
Gully_ gathering experience day by day_ was soon able to play a prominent part in the heavy speculations which formed a feature of the turf in those times and whenever he thought any commission entrusted to him was a really good one—that is to say_ as denoting the chance of the horse to win—he followed the lead of his employer_ and by doing so often won considerable sums whilst if he knew_ as he frequently did_ that a horse was sure * be beaten_ he would spiritedly lay the odds against its chance of winning.,to,day's,forth,Great
It is recorded that on one occasion he was engaged to back two horses in a race to win_ and_ along with a confederate_ he had * to lay against the two which he backed to win ran first and second_ the others_ as had been \"arranged_\" came in a long way behind the winner.,five,resorts,extra,hardship
A few chances * that kind soon bring grist to a betting man's mill.,of,fault,RIGHT,sight
By the year 1827 Gully's business had so flourished that he was able to purchase for £4_200 (then a large sum to pay for a horse) the winner of that year's Blue Ribbon of the turf—Mameluke_ the property * Lord Jersey.,of,fragments,Guide,concert
The horse was bought with a view to winning the St. Leger_ and the transactions made * Gully on behalf of his purchase afford a glimpse of the betting figures of that period.,by,counting,When,hitting
As soon as the bargain had been effected between Lord Jersey * himself_ Gully requested that it should not be made known till he had obtained a good opportunity of backing the horse for the great race of September (the St. Leger)_ which he was enabled to do at Ascot.,and,Arms\",alarm,Stakes
At that famous race meeting * accepted the odds of 10 to 1 against his horse to the tune of £1_000_ thus standing to win £10_000 if his horse should prove victorious at Doncaster.,he,called,high-mettled,feat
Not contented_ however_ with that considerable speculation_ Mr. Gully * several other bets_ as_ for instance_ one that Mameluke would beat ten horses (in the St. Leger)_ which horses he at once named likewise that his colt would beat a lot of nine horses in the same race—these he also_ of course_ named.,made,o'clock,can,productive
All three bets were made for * same amounts_ namely_ £10_000 to £1_000_ and in the end they had to be paid by Mr. Gully_ as_ unfortunately for him_ the name of Matilda_ the horse which won the St. Leger of 1827_ was written in both lists_ so that after the St. Leger had been run he found he had a sum of £3_000 to pay_ every penny of which was duly handed over—two-thirds of it to Crockford—on the day of reckoning.,the,(which,sixty-ninth,abuse
The struggle for that year's St. Leger was no sooner over than it was alleged * had been foul play in connection with the race_ and there is great probability that the allegation was not unfounded_ and that Mameluke was \"prevented\" from winning the race—a species of \"turf tactics\" not unknown even at present_ and occasionally resorted to when other modes of \"getting at\" a horse_ or his trainer_ or jockey_ do not prove successful.,there,Baird,alas,flattery
The chicanery of the turf is varied in its action: when the animal itself can be \"doctored_\" that of course makes certain the \"nobbled\" horse will lose a pail of water—\"just a real hearty drink\" (as a well-known northern trainer used to say)—given to the animal a little time before * race falls to be run_ generally_ but not always_ ensures defeat.,the,been,Great,refused
Other means of \"doctoring\" a racehorse are sometimes resorted to_ it being always a safer plan to make the horse \"right\" than to depend upon a jockey to \"pull it_\" as riders whose evil intention has been suspected have * changed at the last moment_ and the horse_ being entrusted to the guidance of an honest jockey_ may win instead of losing the race.,been,dark-eyed,gentry,erection
In the case of Matilda_ it has been stated that the starter was the guilty party—that_ in fact_ he had been bribed to give his signal to \"go\" when it would be least advantageous to Mr. Gully's horse_ which_ * a restless_ irritable animal_ contributed much to the tactics of the opposition by its fractiousness at the starting-post.,being,stallions,can—if,postponed
The winner of the race was the property of Mr. Petre_ who has been mentioned as being a patron of Robert Ridsdale_ and in * probability that person was the engineer of the opposition to Gully's horse.,all,God,portraits,booths
The two ultimately became partners_ or \"confederates_\" in a good many of the turf events of their day but it is quite clear they were not acting in concert at Doncaster on the occasion of the St. Leger of 1827. At what date a formal partnership—if any such ever existed—was entered upon by Ridsdale and Gully is not known_ but it is more than likely they had on some occasions \"worked the oracle\" * for their mutual advantage before the period of their partnership.,together,responsibility,license,certainty
Ridsdale had become * man of means_ lived in good style_ and was at one time possessed of a hundred horses_ keeping up a liberal establishment.,a,lowest,nigger,prominence
Considering his beginnings_ he was apparently a man of considerable culture he possessed some of the best books of the period_ and also read_ or at any rate purchased_ all the popular * of his day_ his living-rooms being usually littered with newspapers and ephemeral prints and pamphlets of the period.,magazines,occasions,\"disguises,burdens
Well-trained servants waited on his * the productions of his cook attracted the attention of his brethren of the hunt his claret was of the best_ so was his port whilst his conversation was always attractive_ and his tongue fluent and persuasive.,guests,must,Taken,chosen
He rode_ of course_ to hounds—indeed_ hunting was a passion with him he had a string of well-bred hunters from which he derived by occasional sales a handsome profit he bred and trained at his place other horses as well_ and was never without a hundred or two with which to accommodate any of his friends who had run * of money.,short,hare,cease,muscular
There can be no question but that Robert Ridsdale had a finger in several of the dirty pies that were * when he was active on the turf.,cooked,non-paying,nature,move
Many a well-planned victory (and even better-managed loss) is said to have * due to his busy brain.,been,chace,\"Very,successors
His machinations were far-reaching_ some of them taking a long time to mature but when such events came off they generally resulted in the * way for Ridsdale_ who was reputed at the time (1824) to have planned a way of winning a very large sum of money over the race for the St. Leger of that year.,right,seats,Drapers,lordship
The story of \"Jerry's victory\" has been often told in * circles and sporting journals.,turf,Blake's,thousand,sober

Jerry_ the winner of the St. Leger of 1824_ was the property of a Mr. Gascoigne_ a well-known sportsman of his day and the horse_ ridden by Benjamin Smith_ a famous jockey of his era_ beat twenty-two competitors in the great struggle * the Blue Ribbon of the North.,for,published:,3.,Lye
Jerry was to have been piloted in the race by one Edwards_ a horseman of that time_ but for good and sufficient reasons he was at the eleventh hour superseded in the saddle by * Smith_ as will presently be shown.,Benjamin,Zemine,melancholy,R.
Croft_ the trainer of the horse_ was * confident of the ability of Jerry to win the St. Leger_ and did not keep his opinion a secret but_ whilst the animal was being wound up for the occasion and was known to be doing all that was required of him on his training ground_ pleasing both the owner and his friends by the style in which he did his morning gallops_ he was apparently an undoubted victim of the \"legs_\" who never tired of betting the odds against his chance of winning the race.,exceedingly,(that,Smith,thirty-six
All comers were readily accommodated_ so that in the course of a few weeks_ to the * astonishment of his trainer and owner_ tens of thousands were industriously laid against Jerry's chance of winning.,great,admiration,opinion,2001

The trainer of the horse_ as the fierce market opposition to it progressed_ naturally enough became suspicious of foul play_ and in consequence watched the course of the betting with feverish anxiety_ but only to find_ as the day for the decision of the race waxed nearer_ that this colt was being more and more \"peppered\" by a * clique of betting men.,certain,auspices,Chief,creation

Having visited the subscription rooms on the Monday before the race_ and listened once more to the babble of opposition to his colt_ Croft was proceeding after a long walk to his quarters_ when_ as he passed a toll on his road_ he witnessed the * of a carriage drawn by four horses_ and while the vehicle was pulled up for a moment he recognised its occupants.,arrival,\"blood,Monkey,shrewdness

When Benjamin Smith was seen on the back of Mr. Gascoigne's colt consternation seized the betting men those of them who a few minutes previously had been loudest in their offers against Jerry now turned round and began to back the horse with all their might_ so as to be able_ in * event of its success_ to lighten their load of liabilities.,the,intense,delicate,1860

The partnership between them was not formed_ it is believed_ till about the year 1829-30. The two men were * all events intimately associated in the winning of the Derby of 1832 by St. Giles_ and the winning of the St. Leger of the same year by Margrave.,at,devices,resent,welshers
Curious tales have been told regarding the victory of St. Giles twenty-two horses contested the race_ in which Margrave (winner * the St. Leger) was a competitor_ whilst Ridsdale also had a colt running in the race but St. Giles_ which started first favourite_ won very easily.,of,autumn,Trumps,why

But_ to use the words of an outspoken turfite_ \"That would have been nothing for such men to do: Ridsdale could have managed such a bit of turf * easily_ being a perfect master of the art of racing roguery.,business,taker,online,£100
\" No objection was_ however_ made to St. Giles on the ground of fraud_ but a caveat was lodged on the ground of wrongful description in * entering of the horse for the race_ which in the Derby and some other classic events_ as is well known_ takes place when the colt is a yearling.,the,annoyed,confirmation,race—\"scratch

Extraordinary revelations have occasionally been made of the amounts won by the confederates by means of St. Giles' victory both of them_ it is certain_ were large gainers by the success of their horse_ in favour of which the \"oracle\" is stated to have been so industriously \"worked\" that not more than three of the * running in that year's Derby were really trying to win the horse placed third was Trustee_ the property of Ridsdale Margrave_ the fourth in the struggle_ belonged to Gully_ and afterwards won the St. Leger.,horses,\"Mat,London's,Trustee

Ridsdale was undoubtedly * adept in such arrangements as have been hinted at with reference to the clearing of the path for his horse.,an,examines,are,Y.
In * year's Derby there would probably be half-a-dozen horses which might have proved more or less dangerous to St. Giles but by some means or other—money_ in fact—the owners of these animals_ or their trainers or jockeys_ would be gained over by the confederacy_ at a cost_ perhaps_ for the half-dozen_ of some twenty or five-and-twenty thousand pounds.,that,archives,fairness,kill\"
As a matter of course_ St. Giles had been used simply as * instrument of gambling as a two-year-old_ his quality as a race-horse had been hidden by his having undoubtedly been \"pulled\" in his earlier races_ so that when the day of his victory arrived_ the odds against his chance might be large enough to make it worth the while of his owner to let him run.,an,essay,horseman,Lyons'
Margrave_ the St. Leger winner_ as has been stated_ ran fourth in the Derby but probably that horse was good enough * have won the Epsom trophy_ had St. Giles not been on duty but_ had it done so_ the odds against its winning the St. Leger would not have been anything like 8 to 1_ the price quoted at the start for the great Doncaster trophy.,to,\"Coursers,Crown,out-door

At the time indicated (1820 to 1845)_ the parishes of St. George's and St. James' swarmed with gambling-houses_ where large or small sums of * could nightly be gained or lost_ as might happen_ and the play at the majority of such houses was well known to fall out largely against the players_ as by many well-planned devices the bankers had points in their favour.,money,prodigious,awake,remark

Coming back to the doings of * hero_ it has to be stated with regard to Crockford that_ although at one period he was in possession of a stud of race-horses_ among the lot being Sultan_ which made some mark on the turf_ he never took a great amount of interest in the noble animal_ preferring to regard it_ like many other men_ as an instrument of gambling but the owner of the St. James' gambling-house was well versed in turf chicanery of all kinds_ and knew in his day most of the prominent spirits of the racing world.,my,stated,\"goes,germane

Another branch of turf business which Crockford conducted at one time was that of \"squaring\" the books of smaller betting men than himself he could always be relied upon_ even at the last moment—that is_ immediately before a race—to lay the odds against such horses as a bookmaker was \"bad\" against_ and required therefore to back back again_ so as not to run greater risk than was compatible with an honest desire to meet engagements_ and pay what was seen to be due after the * was determined.,race,£7000.,diplomacy,Tennysons
The palatial gaming club erected by Crockford was at one time looked upon as one of the wonders of * two or three houses had been knocked down to provide a site for it_ and no expense was spared to render it commodious and luxurious_ and make it attractive to visitors_ who were waited upon by footmen in gorgeous liveries_ and had their palates tickled by the gastronomic delicacies of Monsieur Ude.,London,Barbs,gleaming,sustained

\" At all events_ when it has been determined by interested parties that a horse shall run to lose a race it has been entered for—and such arrangements are common enough—nothing * easier than to make sure that it shall do so_ and that the horse selected_ in the event of the public fancying him_ shall be made a market horse_ and be \"milked\" for the benefit of those interested: the losing of a race may at any time be ensured_ and there are scores of \"turf dairymen\" who are reputed adepts in the use of the milking pail.,is,our,exponent,landed

Certain bookmakers will lay from ten to twenty-five_ or even forty thousand pounds upon occasion_ against each of half-a-dozen horses entered to run in an * handicap_ and if the one or two of these animals which appear most likely to win the race can—if they have been well backed—in some way be rendered unfit to run_ so much the better for those who have laid the odds.,important,tactics,exigible,replacement

What was generally resolved upon to begin with was_ that each of those present should_ a month before the race_ find out by means of a * trial his best horse for the handicap at the published weights next_ that in a couple of days thereafter the three should be tried together along with the best public horse they were able to buy or borrow to take part in the trial at a weight agreed upon.,formal,limitation,London,fifty-six

When the Mr. Smooth of * an enterprise has made some progress in his negotiations_ he often enough finds himself face to face with the representative of another clique engaged in the same business it is not_ indeed_ the first time that three distinct syndicates have come into collision_ each fancying itself to hold the winning card.,such,conviction,pumped,cull

However good a horse may be_ and however long the animal may have been kept with a view to a grand * it may be found when the weights are published that it is not given such a good chance as that supposed to be conferred on some other animal_ the result being that the owner does not accept_ and probably_ to his great chagrin_ finds his rival also among the non-contents_ his rival having been imbued with similar fears.,,effective,stuff,plaintiff
At other times a lot of horses do not accept because \"something\" has been \"thrown in\" at a feather weight which everybody thinks cannot possibly be beaten_ although in the end that something runs nearly last_ Ruperra to wit_ in the Royal Hunt Cup of 1880.

When they find_ after a trial with some horse of their own or one borrowed from a friend_ that they have no chance of * the race for which the horse has been entered_ they at once strike it out of that race—\"scratch it\" is the usual phrase employed—so that the public may not be induced to back it.,winning,there's,depended,weighing

It has become a debatable * in the ethics of horse-racing whether the owner of a horse_ having once entered it in a public race_ should withdraw it from participation in that race from not being able to back it on his own terms_ because of Tom_ Dick_ and Harry having been more active than he has been in dealing with the bookmakers_ and so forestalling him in the market.,point,trip,learn,grist
There are certain horses in every race which the public  not be withheld from backing they are estimated on a review of their previous form to have such a fine chance_ that no sooner is their weight for any given handicap made known_ than the public are quick to take all the * shots_ leaving the owner—what is left.,long,with,grow,Bass's

In reality it is the general public who provide the money which the bookmakers lay to owners of horses as some owners never bet_ whilst others bet only to small sums_ it is evident_ therefore_ that without the aid of the crowns_ half-sovereigns_ and pounds of the small bettors it would be impossible for the bookmakers to deal * those large sums which gentlemen occasionally back their horses to win.,in,Norwich,comparative,doubtless

Another phase of the * of the turf may be now alluded to_ arising from the mercenary spirit of certain greedy owners—it is the practice of an owner to take a big bet about one of his horses_ and leave his \"lot\" in the hands of a bookmaker to \"work\" in the market as he pleases.,chicanery,Sheick,condescend,mail-cart
The right of a man to wallop his own nigger has been asserted in the same spirit there are men who_ having accepted in a handicap or other race with four or five horses_ claim to do with them as they please_ * what this style of doing business leads to can be gathered from the preceding pages.,and,\"flat,Minister,merest

In towns where there is a great deal of betting_ and in * several bookmakers_ receiving from half-a-dozen to twenty messages every day_ denoting changes in the betting or other occurrences during the progress of a race meeting_ the telegraph clerks have been known to be so tampered with that information of an important kind meant only for one person has been made public.,consequence,notably,Glencoe,Constable

Say that a message is sent from an agent in London to a bookmaker in Liverpool_ that Judas_ an acceptor_ is being heavily backed for the Cesarewitch_ and that from being at 50 to 1 the previous night he is now at 100 to 6 the clerk will delay the message on some pretence or other for ten or twelve minutes_ so that a confederate may have time to visit * or two bookmakers and obtain the longer odds_ well knowing that the effect of the message will be to make the horse named a prime favourite in the local betting_ so that if 50 to 1 can be obtained_ a profit may be made by retailing the bet at a third of the odds.,one,visits,17,singularly

Mr. Salisbury Moor_ having been informed by his trainer that his horse_ Fatcheeks_ had won a very excellent trial for an important handicap_ resolved in consequence_ in conjunction with Bill Gaiters_ his trainer_ to back his animal to win the odds to £300 the odds against the horse (there being three in the same stable_ each thought to have a better chance than Fatcheeks) being at the time nominally 66 to 1.

The sayings and doings of the turf world in connection with \"the Lady Elizabeth Scandal\" formed the subject of newspaper comment * such an extent at the time_ that nearly every person in the habit of reading the public prints must have been somewhat familiar with the unhappy story_ which may be briefly retold in these pages.,to,before,mantle,\"retain\"
Lady Elizabeth belonged to the Marquis of Hastings_ and was at one time first favourite for the Derby won by Bluegown_ the property of Sir Joseph Hawley_ in 1868_ much to the astonishment of hundreds of persons who * the Marquis's filly was \"sure to win.,believed,roost,outlays,Daly
\" Lady Elizabeth_ * her two-year-old career_ had never but once known defeat_ as can be seen by referring to the turf chronicles of 1867_ in which year the value of the stakes won by her reached a total of £9_665. The race which her ladyship failed to win during her two-year-old career was an important one_ namely_ the Middle Park Plate_ which race fell to fortunate Sir Joseph by the aid of his horse_ Greensleeve Rosicrucian_ an animal belonging to the same owner_ running second.,during,10th,that,Spring
No sooner had the struggle for the Blue Ribbon of 1868 been decided—in which Lady Elizabeth was nearer last than first_ although she started the undoubted favourite for the * with odds of 7 to 4 betted against her chance—than persons began to shake their heads and give utterance to the usual stereotyped remarks germane to such occasions_ as_ \"I told you so_\" \"A rank stiff one_\" \"What a scandal_\" and so forth.,event,suit,granted,gratification
In plain language_ * was assumed by a large section of the public that Lady Elizabeth had never been intended to win the Derby_ but that_ on the contrary_ the mare had been for months an abject \"market horse_\" and that thousands of pounds had been invested on the animal for the benefit of the Marquis and his aiders and abettors in the fraud that all connected with Lady Elizabeth_ from her owner down to the boy who every morning removed the litter from her stall_ had made fortunes by means of the milking pail which had been in such constant requisition! Moreover it was currently stated among numerous reports circulated that Admiral Rous had asserted that the mare_ just previous to the race_ had been heavily drugged with laudanum but the Admiral_ in a letter to  newspaper under the date of June 15th_ 1868_ gave an emphatic contradiction to that report.,it,Queen,Exchanges,admired
In continuation_ the Admiral went on to say: \"My belief * that Lady Elizabeth had a rough spin with Athena in March_ when the Days discovered she had lost her form—a very common occurrence with fillies severely trained at two years old that when the discovery was made they reversed a commission to back her for the One Thousand Guineas at Newmarket and they declared that Lord Hastings would not bring her out before the Derby_ on which he stood to win a great stake.,is,eating,public,signalise

\" An * at law was threatened by Mr. John Day_ of Danebury_ against the Admiral_ but the threat never came to anything_ as will be seen in the sequel and here it may be proper to give Mr. Day's own explanation of the condition of Lady Elizabeth immediately previous to the date of the Derby.,action,referring,£1,commit

In an excellent_ although brief_ * of the history of the Club contributed to the \"Badminton Library_\" we are told that tradition points to its origin in the year 1750_ before which time the usual meeting-place for gentlemen attending Newmarket was the \"Red Lion Inn_\" the site of which is supposed to have been on the present Station Road.,sketch,Darley's,sealed,watch:

Strictly speaking_ the Jockey Club had no authority or power to extend or enforce the observance of their laws at any other meetings than * held at Newmarket but it soon became evident that a uniform and general application of its rules or laws was desirable_ and therefore by a sort of tacit understanding it gradually became customary for all race meetings of importance to place themselves under the laws of the Jockey Club by a general consent and acknowledgment of its authority.,those,Pastile,persistently,wager
In many cases_ however_ there was a doubt respecting the extent and power of application of the said laws_ and therefore_ in 1831_ the Jockey Club notified that their rules and orders applied to Newmarket _ but they recommended their adoption to the stewards of other races_ and in places where they were publicly adopted and recognised the Jockey Club would investigate and * on disputes submitted to them for adjudication_ but not otherwise.,decide,horses,contest,derive

* sums of money are also derived from charges of admission made at various stands and enclosures pertaining to the different racecourses_ and these are being multiplied by order of the Club_ which seems to be fashioning racing on the Heath pretty much in the same way as if the meetings held under its auspices were gate-money meetings.,Considerable,What,Theodore,past\"

In truth_ looking up as the sporting public do to this body as the chief and sovereign head of their own community for either approbation or condemnation_ and with such serious obligations on their own part_ and weighty and grave matters to deal with and adjudicate upon as regards others_ it behoves them to be careful in their own actions_ and * in investigating and deciding upon the action of others.,tender,stockbrokers,steeple-chasing,copyright

The jurisdiction of the Jockey Club will always_ in my opinion_ be incomplete till it accepts the responsibility of laying down the law in questions as to disputed bets_ and of deciding when horses are in a race or when they are not as_ for instance_ in the case of Maskelyne_ about which there was a few years ago much discussion_ resulting in the illogical conclusion that_ although the entry of that horse was informal_ and consequently inept_ those who backed it were ordered by the committee of Tattersall's to pay their bets! Why should it be possible to make an informal entry of any horse for any race? Hitherto it appears to have been among the unwritten laws of the turf that any person might enter any animal he pleased in any way he liked_ without let or hindrance_ and * one can still do so_ and thus open a wide door to fraud.,any,£2700.,Buckhounds,protected

The Club_ as lawgiver of the turf and as its own executive_ is despotic it makes laws and alters them at discretion the plain truth is_ it seems to be perpetually engaged in the patching of the * of Racing_\" which have been the growth of the last seventy or eighty years_ and which_ instead of being occasionally patched_ ought to be revised from beginning to end—or_ perhaps_ if they were \"entirely reconstructed\" it would be better.,\"Rules,every,figurative,Pyrrhus
